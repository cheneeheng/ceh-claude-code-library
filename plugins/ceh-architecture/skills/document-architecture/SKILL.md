  Load this skill when creating or updating the project's living architecture document — an
  ARCHITECTURE.md that is mainly Mermaid diagrams plus a Key Decisions log. Trigger when the user
  says "write the architecture doc", "add architecture diagrams", "create ARCHITECTURE.md",
  "document the system architecture", "diagram the system", "update the architecture doc",
  "record this decision", or asks for a high-level overview or mental model of what the project
  does. Also load when a version re-plan changes the system's shape (new component, changed data
  flow, reversed design choice) and the current picture or decision log must be brought back in
  sync.

# Document architecture

Maintain one living `.agents_workspace/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the always-current picture of the system.
It opens with a 3-second **Overview**, then is **mainly Mermaid diagrams**, then a
**Key Decisions** log that holds the durable, cross-version "why".

This is the durable counterpart to a plan's §02 architecture diagram. The plan visualizes one
version's _change_; `ARCHITECTURE.md` shows the _whole current system_ and the decision trail behind
it. It absorbs what used to be standalone ADRs — there is no separate `docs/adr/` tree.

## Rules

- **Mermaid, never ASCII art.** Diagrams must render and stay diffable.
- **Show what exists, not what's aspirational.** If it isn't built, it isn't in the diagram.
- **One line of prose per diagram** stating what it shows — never a wall of text.
- **One screen per diagram is the ceiling.** When one stops fitting, split it by subsystem — never
  shrink the labels to buy room.
- **Update on shape change, not on every commit.** A diagram is stale only when the system no
  longer matches it; then the diagram and any new decision land in that same change.

## The 3-second read

`ARCHITECTURE.md` opens with an `## Overview` section a newcomer absorbs in under three seconds,
before any diagram. It answers "what is this thing?" and nothing else. Exactly two parts:

1. **One sentence** — what the system does, and for whom: an end user, an operator, or the
   developer importing it. Problem-domain words only.
2. **One line of shape** — the whole system as a single left-to-right flow, 3–6 nodes.

## Overview

Shoppers browse a catalogue and place orders; staff fulfil them from an admin console.

```mermaid

    shopper([Shopper]) --> store[Storefront] --> orders[Orders API] --> fulfil[Fulfilment]
```
````

- **Three seconds is the acceptance test.** One sentence, one flow line, no scrolling. If the reader
  has to parse a branch or a legend, it failed — cut until it passes.
- **Domain nouns, not codebase nouns.** `Orders`, `Fulfilment` — never `OrderAggregateService`,
  and never a framework or database name; those belong in the Components diagram.
- **Linear, never branching.** The overview is the spine. Externals, alternate paths, and every
  other actor go in the System context and Components diagrams — that is what they are for.
- **Rewrite it only when the system's purpose changes.** The spine survives most refactors; if it
  churns commit to commit, it is carrying detail that belongs in a real diagram.
- **An existing doc without one gets one first.** When updating an `ARCHITECTURE.md` that predates
  this section, write the Overview before any other edit — it is the cheapest part to produce and
  the part most readers never get past.

## The standard diagram set

Include the diagrams that apply; omit ones the system doesn't have. Order them outside-in.
**System context earns a separate diagram only when the externals are too many to sit legibly on
Components.** Otherwise draw them on Components, outside the boundary, as the example below does.

| Diagram        | Mermaid type      | Shows                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System context | `flowchart`       | External actors and systems around the boundary — who/what talks to it                          |
| Components     | `flowchart`       | **The expanded Overview** — every internal piece and what crosses each connection (rules below) |
| Key flows      | `sequenceDiagram` | 1–3 critical request/lifecycle paths end to end                                                 |
| Data model     | `erDiagram`       | Core entities and relationships (mirrors `domain-modeling` entities)                            |
| State machines | `stateDiagram-v2` | Legal status transitions for key entities (mirrors `domain-modeling` status rules)              |

**Components is the Overview with the detail put back** — same system, no longer a line. The
Overview is a spine _by rule_; Components branches, fans out, and loops back wherever the real
system does. There is no separate "expanded overview" diagram; when you want more than the spine,
you want this one:

- **Branch freely — that is the point.** The Overview's one-line constraint does not carry over.
  Fan-out, loop-backs, and every external the spine had to drop belong here.
- **Label every edge** with what crosses it — protocol, payload, or verb. A bare arrow says two
  things touch, not how; that is the difference between a picture and a diagram.
- **Draw the trust or deployment boundary as a `subgraph`.** Anything outside it is someone else's
  system: you cannot change it, and it fails independently.
- **Name the technology on the node** (`Orders API · FastAPI`). This is the diagram where stack
  names belong.
- **Skip it if it adds nothing.** If Components would be the Overview plus a node or two, the system
  is small enough that the Overview _is_ the whole picture — ship it alone and move on.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    shopper([Shopper]) -->|HTTPS| fe[Storefront · SvelteKit]
    subgraph platform [Platform boundary]
        fe -->|REST /api| api[Orders API · FastAPI]
        api -->|SQL| db[(PostgreSQL)]
        api -->|enqueue job| queue[[Job Queue]]
        queue --> worker[Fulfilment Worker]
        worker -->|SQL| db
    end
    api -->|charge| stripe([Stripe])
    worker -->|book label| carrier([Carrier API])
```

State-machine diagrams must match the `domain-modeling` rule that not all transitions are legal —
draw only the legal edges:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> active
    active --> archived
    archived --> active
    active --> deleted
    archived --> deleted
```

## Key Decisions

The durable record of significant architectural decisions — ones that would confuse a future
developer without context, or that reversing would require a migration or refactor. This is the
single home for decision rationale; record one whenever you choose a framework/runtime/persistence
strategy, pick between fundamentally different patterns, plan a major dependency upgrade, or reverse
a prior decision in a new version.

Append entries to a `## Key Decisions` section at the bottom of `ARCHITECTURE.md`, newest last:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <Short, Descriptive Title>

**Status:** Accepted | Superseded by <date title>
**Context:** Problem, constraints, and options considered.
**Decision:** What was decided — explicit and unambiguous.
**Consequences:** Trade-offs, limitations, follow-ups.
```

- **Never delete a decision.** To change one, append a new entry and mark the old one
  `Superseded by <date title>`. The trail is the cross-version narrative.
- **Never silently diverge** from an accepted decision — supersede it on the record first.
- Keep entries short. The diagrams carry the structure; these carry the reasoning.

## Storage

`.agents_workspace/ARCHITECTURE.md`. For a large system, the diagram set may
move to `.agents_workspace/architecture/` with one file per view, but the `## Overview` and
`## Key Decisions` sections stay in `ARCHITECTURE.md` itself — the spine and the decision trail must
remain readable and greppable in one place.

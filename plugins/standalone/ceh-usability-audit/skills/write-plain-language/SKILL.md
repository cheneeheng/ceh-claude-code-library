  Load this skill when writing or rewriting words a user reads inside the product — button and field
  labels, empty states, onboarding copy, tooltips, confirmation dialogs, CLI help text, setting
  names, or a docs page a beginner has to follow. Supplies the vocabulary floor and swap table, the
  sentence rules, the define-on-first-use rule for surviving domain terms, button and label
  conventions, and an explicit list of what must never be simplified. Trigger on "make this
  clearer", "simplify this wording", "rewrite this for non-technical users", "plain English",
  "reword this label", "our copy is too technical", "explain this in simpler terms", "write the
  empty state", or when naming a button, field, setting, or command. Not for error text (use
  ceh-usability-audit:audit-error-messages), whole-interface structure (use
  ceh-usability-audit:audit-interface), or marketing copy (use ceh-seo:write-project-listing-text).

# Write in plain language

The instruction "write simply" is not the useful part — every writer already agrees with it and
still ships "Configure your workspace to initiate synchronization." What produces clear copy is a
**floor you can check a word against**, and a list of the things you must not simplify.

The failure is rarely that the writer chose a hard word on purpose. It is that the implementation's
vocabulary is the vocabulary they have been living in for weeks, and it reads as ordinary to them.

## Procedure

1. **Harvest the strings.** UI labels and copy from the component/template files, CLI text from
   `--help` and the argument parser, plus any user-facing constants file. Errors are out of scope
   here — route those to `audit-error-messages`.
2. **Run the floor over every string**, then the sentence rules. Most rewrites fall out mechanically.
3. **Check one-name consistency.** The same concept must have exactly one word across UI, CLI, API,
   docs, and errors. Two good names for one thing is still a defect — list every alias and pick one.
4. **Produce a rewrite table**, current → proposed, one row per string. Do not rewrite in place
   without showing the table first; copy changes are cheap to make and expensive to review buried in
   a diff.
5. **Read the result aloud.** It is the only reliable check, and it catches every rule below at once.

## Rules

### The vocabulary floor

**Every word must be one a twelve-year-old reads without pausing.** That is the whole rule. When a
word fails it, swap it — and there is nearly always a shorter word that is also more precise.

| Don't              | Do              |     | Don't                  | Do              |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| utilize, leverage  | use             |     | authenticate           | sign in         |
| initiate, commence | start           |     | provision, instantiate | create, set up  |
| terminate          | stop, end       |     | configure              | set up          |
| execute            | run             |     | populate               | fill in         |
| modify             | change          |     | validate               | check           |
| prior to           | before          |     | in order to            | to              |
| subsequent to      | after           |     | in the event that      | if              |
| facilitate         | help            |     | is able to             | can             |
| additional         | more            |     | attempt to             | try             |
| require            | need            |     | sufficient             | enough          |
| currently          | now (or cut it) |     | at this time           | now (or cut it) |

Product-specific nouns are worse than verbs, because a swap table cannot fix them. `instance`,
`payload`, `entity`, `resource`, `workspace`, `tenant`, `sync`, `token`, `cache`, `hook`, `job`,
`pipeline` — each is either a thing the user recognizes under a different name, or a concept they do
not have. Name it what the user calls it, and if the user has no word for it, the concept probably
should not be on the surface.

### Sentence rules

1. **One idea per sentence.** Two ideas joined by "and" or a semicolon are two sentences.
2. **Twenty words maximum.** Read it aloud; if you take a breath mid-sentence, split it.
3. **Active voice, user as the subject.** "You'll get an email" — not "An email will be sent".
4. **Present tense.** "This deletes your files", not "This will delete your files".
5. **Second person.** "your project", not "the user's project".
6. **Front-load the point.** The consequence goes first, the qualification second: "Your files stay
   for 30 days, then they're deleted" — not the other way round.
7. **Cut the throat-clearing.** "Please note that", "It is important to understand that", "Simply",
   "Just" — all deletable, and "simply"/"just" additionally tell someone who is stuck that their
   difficulty is unreasonable.

### Define on first use, in the interface

Any domain term that survives the floor — because it genuinely is the user's word, or because there
is no shorter one — **gets defined where it first appears, not in a glossary**. Someone confused by
a word will not go looking for a page that explains it.

```
Bad:   Webhook URL
Good:  Webhook URL
       Where we send updates when something changes. Your server needs to accept POST requests here.
```

One sentence beneath the label. If it needs a paragraph, the concept is too big for this screen.

### Labels, buttons, and numbers

- **Button labels are verbs naming the outcome:** "Save changes", "Delete 3 files", "Send invite".
  Never "OK", "Submit", "Yes", "Confirm". Someone reading only the button must know what happens.
- **A confirmation dialog's buttons must not be "Yes" and "No"** — they must be "Delete forever" and
  "Keep it". The dialog text can be skipped; the buttons cannot.
- **Placeholder text is not a label.** It disappears exactly when the user needs it, and greyed
  text reads as disabled. Always a real, visible label.
- **A checkbox says what happens when it is checked**, phrased positively. `Don't disable
notifications` is unreadable in both states.
- **Give numbers, not adjectives.** "About 2 minutes" beats "Processing". "3 of 7" beats a spinner.
  "Up to 25 MB" beats "large files not supported".
- **Time is relative first, absolute on hover or beside:** "3 hours ago" over `2026-08-01T09:14Z`.
- **Empty states carry the first action as a control**, not as a sentence. "No projects yet" plus a
  **Create your first project** button — not "You can create a project from the menu above."

### Never simplify these

Simplification that removes precision is a regression, not an improvement. These stay exact even
when they read badly:

| Keep exact                                     | Why                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legal, consent, licensing, and privacy wording | Meaning is the obligation; paraphrase changes what was agreed                      |
| Safety and destructive-action consequences     | "This can't be undone" is the whole message. Softening it costs data               |
| Security wording, and auth failure detail      | Vagueness on auth is deliberate — never say _which_ of email or password was wrong |
| Exact identifiers, versions, paths, commands   | A friendlier rendering of a value the user must copy is a broken value             |
| Exact numbers, limits, and units               | "A few" is not a limit anyone can plan against                                     |
| The actual failing value in an error           | See `audit-error-messages` — the quoted value is the message                       |

Ambiguity is the cost of over-simplifying, and it is a usability failure in its own right. **Say
less, not vaguer.**

## Output

A rewrite table, shown before any string is changed in place:

| Location               | Current                   | Proposed                         | Rule          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `SettingsPanel.tsx:42` | `Configure sync interval` | `How often to check for updates` | floor, jargon |

## Stop conditions

- **The term is the user's own word.** Accountants say "reconcile"; doctors say "triage".
  Simplifying to a general-audience word makes it _less_ clear for the actual audience → establish
  who the reader is before running the floor.
- **The string is a public contract** — a CLI flag name, an API field, a documented setting key.
  Renaming it is a breaking change, not a copy edit → flag it and route to
  `ceh-python-library:publish-python-library`.
- **The copy is fine and the interface is the problem.** Better words for a step that should not
  exist is the wrong fix → route to `audit-interface`.

## Hands off to

- The string is an error message: `ceh-usability-audit:audit-error-messages`.
- The wording is a symptom of a confusing flow: `ceh-usability-audit:audit-interface`.
- Does a newcomer get far enough to read this at all? `ceh-usability-audit:simulate-newcomer-first-run`.
- It's a docs page, not in-product copy: `ceh-documentation:write-guides-and-runbooks` for a guide
  or runbook, `ceh-documentation:write-concept-docs` for an explanation.
- It's the README first screen or a package description: `ceh-seo:write-project-listing-text`.
- The label is unreadable to a screen reader or has no accessible name:
  `ceh-web-frontend:make-ui-accessible`.

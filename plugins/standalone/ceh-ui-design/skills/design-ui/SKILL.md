# Design the Frontend UI

Deliver a UI that is modern, intuitive, and coherent. Done when the review pass at the end of the
Rules passes.

## Procedure

Work in this order:

1. **Design pass** — answer the five questions below _before_ writing any markup.
2. **Theme** — install one of the bundled token-driven templates (_Theme layer_, end of this file).
   Never hand-roll colors, type, or spacing.
3. **Build** — apply the _Rules_ below, core rules then _Finishing recipes_, consulting
   `references/examples.md` (worked good/bad markup per section) and the chosen theme's
   `brand-guide.html`.
4. **Review pass** — run the checklist before calling the UI done.

Two failure modes produce almost all bad UI, and this file targets both:

- **Unexamined defaults** — everything centered, everything boxed, uniform spacing, no visual
  priority. The design pass and core rules force those decisions explicitly.
- **The primitive draft** — structurally correct but unfinished: default table styling, raw
  symbols for data, status as plain text, buttons floating in space. The finishing recipes close
  that gap on the first build, not after review.

### The design pass

Answer these five questions and state the answers (one line each) so the choices are reviewable:

1. **What kind of surface is this?** Data-dense tool, content/marketing page, focused single-task
   flow, or metric overview. This classification drives every later choice.
2. **Which layout archetype fits?** (table below)
3. **What is the one primary action per view?** Everything else is visually subordinate.
4. **Which theme template?** (Theme layer below)
5. **What do empty, loading, and error look like?** Designed now, not retrofitted.

## Rules

### Layout

#### Pick one archetype per surface

| Archetype          | Use for                                               | Structure                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **App shell**      | Data-dense tools, ≥6 nav destinations, daily-use apps | Fixed sidebar (nav) + scrollable content pane; topbar only for global search/account |
| **Top-nav**        | Content and marketing sites, ≤5 destinations          | Horizontal nav bar + full-width sections below                                       |
| **Focused flow**   | Auth, checkout, onboarding, wizards, single forms     | Single centered column, minimal or no nav, one action per step                       |
| **Dashboard grid** | Metric overviews, monitoring                          | App shell + card grid; cards sized by importance, not uniformly                      |

The surface kind (design-pass question 1) picks the archetype; the destination count only breaks a
tie between two that both fit.

Do not mix archetypes on one surface. An app does not get a marketing hero; a login page does not
get a sidebar. An in-page contents rail (_Navigation_) is not an archetype and does not count.

#### Content width

- Prose: 65–75 characters per line (`max-width: 65ch`). Never let body text span a wide viewport.
- Forms: 480–640px column, labels above inputs. Full-width forms read as broken.
- Data tables: may use the full content pane — density is the point.
- Page content in an app shell: cap around 1200–1400px and left-align within the pane; do not
  stretch to fill a 4K monitor.

#### Alignment and spacing rhythm

- Pick one alignment axis and keep it: **left-align** text-heavy and app UIs. Center only focused
  flows and marketing heroes. Centered body text is the single most common generic-AI tell.
- Proximity encodes relationship: space **within** a group must be visibly smaller than space
  **between** groups. Section gaps run 2–4× element gaps. If all gaps are equal, the page has no
  structure regardless of how many boxes it has.
- Use only the theme's spacing tokens (4px grid). No off-scale values.
- One gutter width per page. Elements that are conceptually aligned must be pixel-aligned.

#### Responsive behavior

Decide the mobile form of the archetype up front: sidebar collapses to a drawer or bottom tab bar
(pick one, not both); top-nav collapses to a menu button; dashboard grids stack to one column in
card-importance order; tables either scroll horizontally in their own container or reflow to
key-value cards — never squash columns.

### Hierarchy

- **One primary action per view.** Exactly one filled/primary button; everything else outline,
  ghost, or link. Two primary buttons means no decision was made.
- **Three visible levels max.** Encode importance with size + weight + color _together_
  (large/bold/ink → medium/medium/ink → small/regular/muted). More levels than three and the eye
  ranks nothing.
- **Max ~4 type sizes per view** from the theme scale. Needing a fifth means the hierarchy is
  wrong, not the scale.
- **Boxes are not structure.** Use whitespace and alignment first, a border rule second, a card
  last. A card groups a set of _peer_ items that need separation from other sets — it is not a
  default wrapper. **Never nest cards in cards.** If everything is in a box, nothing is grouped.

#### When a page title appears — and when it doesn't

- Show a title (`h1`) when the page has an identity beyond its nav label: an entity name
  ("Invoice #1042"), a scope ("Settings — Billing"), or content the user navigated into.
- Skip the standalone title when it would only repeat the active nav item with zero added
  information — in an app shell, the highlighted nav item already says "Dashboard"; a lone
  "Dashboard" `h1` under it is noise. Either add value (count, date range, status) or drop it and
  promote the content — in app shells, the eyebrow-above-panel header (_Finishing recipes_) is the
  usual replacement.
- Focused flows title the _task_, not the app: "Create your account", not "Signup Page".
- Standard header anatomy when a title exists: optional eyebrow (uppercase micro-label for
  category/context) → title → one-line description → header-level actions right-aligned on the same
  row. One `h1` per page, always.

### Navigation

- **Placement follows the archetype:** sidebar for app shells (vertical scan, scales past 5 items),
  top bar for content sites, **tabs** only for peer views of the _same_ object or section (they
  switch content in place, never navigate away), **breadcrumbs** only when hierarchy is ≥3 levels
  deep.
- **Order by frequency of use**, never alphabetically. The most-used destination sits first/top;
  Settings, account, and sign-out go last (sidebar bottom or top-bar far right).
- **Max 7 top-level items.** Beyond that, group under labeled sections (sidebar) or consolidate:
  past about seven, users scan the list instead of finding the item.
- **The active location must be visibly marked** — a filled/edged state on the current nav item
  (the theme's `.has-edge.is-active` exists for exactly this). A user should know where they are
  from the nav alone.
- Icons in nav are optional; if used, every item gets one (no partial icon rows) and each icon is
  paired with its text label. Icon-only nav requires an established, unambiguous icon set.

#### In-page contents

A long single document (report, spec, docs page) lists its own sections. Those links scroll, they
do not navigate, so the frequency-order and max-7 rules above do not apply.

- **Show it** when the page has ≥4 `h2` sections or runs past ~3 screens.
- **On a content page, the top bar comes first.** A standalone document with ≤5 sections puts its
  section links in the top bar, and that is its whole navigation.
- **Add a contents rail only when the top bar cannot carry the sections:** ≥6 `h2` sections,
  sections that need `h3` links, or a top bar already full of site destinations. In an app shell
  the rail is the only option.
- **Rail placement:** sticky beside the content on wide screens, on the right when a sidebar
  already holds the left. On narrow screens it becomes a static list above the first section,
  never a horizontal scroller.
- **Document order.** Link every `h2` with its heading text; add `h3` one indent down only for
  long sections.
- **Mark the section in view** with `.has-edge.is-active` plus `aria-current="location"`, driven by
  an `IntersectionObserver` on the sections. The URL cannot say where the reader is.
- **Offset jumps:** with any sticky header, set `scroll-padding-top` to its height so a jumped-to
  heading never lands under it.

### Color and depth

- **Neutral-dominant:** roughly 90% of any view is surface + ink + border tokens. Brand color is
  reserved for the primary action, active/selected states, and focus — that scarcity is what makes
  it read as "the important thing".
- **Semantic colors carry meaning only.** Success/warning/danger appear when something _is_
  successful, at risk, or destructive — never as decoration or variety.
- **One depth language.** The templates each pick it (Meridian: soft shadows; Tidewater: borders).
  Do not add both a border and a shadow and a background tint to the same element.
- **Layer the page with the surface ladder.** The three background tokens are a depth ladder, not
  interchangeable fills: page chrome (topbar, sidebar) sits on `--bg` and recedes; command
  surfaces (docks, framed panels) sit on `--surface`; interactive, clickable cards step up to
  `--surface-2` so the brightest things on screen are the ones that open. When chrome, toolbar,
  and content all share one background they blend into a single slab.
- Data-viz uses the `--data-*` ramp in order; do not invent chart colors.

### States: design the unhappy paths first

Every list, table, and detail view ships with all four states designed:

- **Empty:** not a blank pane — one line of what belongs here plus the primary action to create it.
  First-run empty states are the highest-leverage screen in an app; give them the header anatomy
  (title, one-liner, action).
- **Loading:** skeleton blocks that mirror the real layout for anything structural; a spinner only
  for sub-second, in-place waits (button click). Never a full-page spinner for a partial update.
- **Error:** what happened + what the user can do (retry, go back), in place, using the danger
  token. Never a raw error string as the whole view.
- **Overflow:** long names truncate with ellipsis + title/tooltip; tables cap visible rows and
  paginate; numbers use tabular figures (`.numeric`) so columns align.

### Density

Match density to usage frequency: tools someone uses all day run dense (32–36px table rows,
`--fs-50/-100` in tables, compact `--space-2/-3` padding); occasional consumer flows run airy
(generous `--space-8+` sections, larger type). Choose once per surface and apply consistently —
mixed density inside one view reads as broken.

### Finishing recipes

The core rules make a UI _correct_; these recipes make it _finished_. Apply them on the first
build. In page order: the command dock (global state), section headers, then how data is displayed
(tables, lifecycle colors, monograms, stat blocks), then controls and motion. Worked markup for
each lives in `references/examples.md`.

#### Command dock — global state and its action

When app-wide state exists (a current run, round, or selection) with one primary action on it, do
not cram it into the topbar and do not repeat it per page. The topbar stays brand + nav; the state
gets a **dock**: a bordered, rounded card floating below the chrome, width-aligned with the
content column so its edges share the cards' gutter.

- **Three panels split by hairline vertical rules, each panel's content centered.** Centered
  blocks floating in open space read as accidental; centered inside delineated panels read as
  deliberate — the rules are what license the centering.
- **Left — identity:** eyebrow (`CURRENT ROUND`) → the state's name at display size (the dock's
  focal point), with metadata as quiet mono chips on the title line, not raw hyperlinks.
- **Center — the action:** the one primary action as an accent-filled pill with a one-line muted
  micro-caption beneath saying what it does ("runs the 2 queued orders"). The center always
  carries the state's _current_ call-to-action — a live progress line while running, the review
  action when finished — and collapses (rules included) when there is no action.
- **Right — outcome:** mirror the left's anatomy with an eyebrow + stat block for the last result;
  the whole panel is a quiet link to the detail/history view.
- Optionally crown the dock with a 2–3px accent rule across its top, echoing the primary button.
- Hide the dock entirely when there is no state and no history — a fresh install gets no empty band.
- **State lives once:** anything the dock shows disappears from individual views — no second
  primary button, no repeated status heading, no duplicate cost readout anywhere in the app.

#### Section headers — eyebrow above the panel

- Label every list, table, and grid section with an uppercase eyebrow plus count (`PROJECTS · 2`)
  and a one-line muted caption explaining what the section is.
- The header sits on the page **above** the panel — never inside the card.
- Use the same vocabulary on every view (`PROJECTS`, `QUEUED ORDERS`, `ROUND HISTORY`) so the
  pages read as one system. This replaces the redundant page title.

#### Humanized tables

Default table styling is the strongest primitive tell. Every data table gets this treatment:

- **Frame it:** the table lives alone in a surface panel; its eyebrow header sits above the panel.
- **Cells read as words, not symbols:** "Round 2", not a `#` column with a bare integer; outcomes
  as color-coded words ("1 succeeded" in success, "2 failed" in danger).
- **Show only what happened:** a red zero is noise — omit zero counts, use an em dash when
  nothing ran.
- **Status is a colored pill** from the lifecycle palette (next recipe), never plain text.
- Numbers use tabular figures; rows get a hover wash and pointer; rows that navigate are keyboard
  operable (`tabindex="0"` + Enter); the last row drops its separator.
- **Highlight the semantically current row, not the first row:** key the highlight to state
  ("the open one") so it retires when the state closes. Idiom: a 2–3px brand edge on the leading
  side plus a faint brand wash, drawn with an inset shadow so column alignment does not shift.
- Any table containing form fields uses `table-layout: fixed` so content cannot renegotiate
  column widths.

#### Lifecycle colors and flow

For any domain state machine (draft → running → review → done):

- Assign each stage one color **once** and use it in every representation — status badge, stepper
  node, history pill — so color alone identifies the stage anywhere in the app.
- Show progression as a **node-and-rail stepper**, not text: small nodes joined by a continuous
  rail, stage labels beneath.
- Past stages muted; the current node lit in its stage color with a soft halo, pulsing only while
  actively running; future stages ghosted. The rail fills through the current node so a transition
  visibly flows forward.

#### Identity monograms

- Entity cards and rows lead with a small rounded monogram tile: the entity's initial on a wash
  tint picked from the `--data-*` ramp by a stable name hash, with a matching hairline border —
  every entity keeps its color everywhere it appears.
- On hover or keyboard focus, slide in a `→` at the card's corner so "this opens" is unmistakable.

#### Stat blocks

- Summary numbers are stats, not sentences: the value at stat size (`--fs-500`, tabular figures)
  over a tiny muted label, an eyebrow above the group.
- Semantic color on the value only when it carries state, and only when nonzero.
- A stat block that navigates is one quiet link — no underline; tint the eyebrow on hover.

#### Inputs on dense surfaces

- A field inside a card is a **recessed well**: `--bg` fill one rung below its card, hairline
  border, brightening on hover, brand border on focus — visible at rest, never a ghost that only
  appears on hover.
- Free text of unpredictable length is an auto-growing textarea: `field-sizing: content` with a
  one-line min-height and a viewport-relative max, plus `overflow-wrap: anywhere` so an unbroken
  string wraps instead of widening the layout.
- Placeholders are ≤3 words ("add instruction…"); the full explanation goes in the tooltip. A long
  placeholder wraps and forces scrollbars in an empty field.
- Theme scrollbars app-wide: `scrollbar-width: thin` with a `--border-strong` thumb on
  transparent — the OS-default chunky scrollbar breaks any polished surface it appears on.

#### Micro-interactions

Exactly one small motion per interactive element, using the theme's motion tokens: the primary
action may lift with a deeper shadow or rotate its glyph on hover; affordances (the monogram `→`)
slide in on hover/focus; state changes transition color rather than snapping. Never animate more
than one property group per element, and never decorate static content with motion.

### Anti-patterns — reject on sight

Structure tells (a design pass never happened):

- Everything centered — body text, forms, and headers all on the center axis.
- Every section boxed: border + shadow + background tint on the same element, cards inside cards.
- Uniform spacing everywhere — no proximity grouping, section gaps equal to element gaps.
- Gradient hero / glassmorphism on an app surface, or on every page of a content site.
- Emoji as icons or bullet decoration in product UI.
- Two or more filled primary buttons in one view.
- A lone `h1` that repeats the active nav label verbatim.
- Brand color as background wash for entire sections "to add visual interest".
- Five type sizes or three font families in one view.
- Happy path only — empty/loading/error left as afterthoughts.

Finish tells (the primitive draft shipped):

- Topbar, toolbars, and content cards all on the same background — no depth ladder, one slab.
- A `#` column header, bare integers, or raw symbols where a word fits ("Round 2", "3 failed").
- A zero rendered in the danger color — show only what happened.
- A state machine rendered as plain text when its stages are known.
- Global state or its primary action repeated on individual views (two "End turn" buttons).
- OS-default scrollbars inside a themed surface.

### Review pass

Before calling the UI done, verify:

1. **Squint test:** blur your mental view — does the primary action and the page's structure still
   read? If it's a uniform gray blur, hierarchy failed.
2. **Alignment audit:** every element sits on the grid; one gutter; no accidental center/left mix.
3. **Spacing audit:** within-group < between-group everywhere; only token values.
4. **One primary action** per view; active nav state visible; title rule applied.
5. **State coverage:** empty, loading, error, overflow all handled.
6. **Token compliance:** no hardcoded hex, px sizes, or shadows — `var(--token)` everywhere.
7. **Finish audit:** depth ladder distinct (chrome vs command surfaces vs clickable cards); table
   cells read as words with lifecycle colors consistent across every representation; section
   eyebrows share one vocabulary; global state and its action appear exactly once.

### Theme layer

Colors, type, spacing values, and component styles come from a bundled template. Do not hand-roll
them — every value is a CSS custom property so the whole app re-themes from one file. Prefer this
bundled style over a generic component library (shadcn/ui, MUI, Mantine) for one coherent look.

#### Choose and install

| Template      | Feel                                                      | Type                                       | Palette                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Meridian**  | Restrained mainstream SaaS; soft elevation, calm neutrals | Inter · JetBrains Mono                     | Cool-gray, blue primary, amber accent |
| **Tidewater** | Editorial / boutique; flat, border-led depth              | Fraunces · Hanken Grotesk · JetBrains Mono | Cool mint ground, terracotta + teal   |

- **Choose:** let the user pick via `AskUserQuestion` (single-select) unless they already named one.
  With no human to answer, take Meridian, the neutral default, and say so. Both templates ship the same token names and component classes, so the choice is purely
  look-and-feel — swap later by replacing one CSS file, with no markup changes. To preview, open
  `references/<name>/brand-guide.html` in a browser or send it with `SendUserFile`.
- **Install:** copy `references/<name>/brand.css` to the project's global stylesheet location
  (follow the project's existing convention) and load it **first**, before any app styles —
  `@import "./brand.css";` at the top of the entry CSS, or
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/brand.css">` for plain HTML. The file brings its own web fonts,
  reset, and bare-element styles, so unclassed markup already looks right.
- **Light/dark:** `data-theme="light"` or `"dark"` on `<html>` forces a theme; omit it to follow
  `prefers-color-scheme`.

#### Build UI against the contract

Use the tokens and classes below — never hardcode a hex, px size, or shadow. Anything the template
does not cover, build with `var(--token)` values so it re-themes with the rest.

##### Tokens (CSS custom properties)

- **Type:** `--font-display`, `--font-ui`, `--font-mono`; scale `--fs-50 … --fs-700`; `--lh-*`,
  `--tracking-*`, `--weight-light … --weight-bold` (Meridian adds `--weight-heavy`).
- **Spacing:** `--space-1 … --space-16` (4px grid).
- **Radius:** `--radius-sm|md|lg|full`.
- **Color:** surfaces `--bg`, `--surface`, `--surface-2`; ink `--fg`, `--fg-muted`, `--fg-subtle`;
  lines `--border`, `--border-strong`; brand `--secondary(-hi/-wash)`, `--accent(-hi/-wash)`;
  state `--success`, `--warning`, `--danger` (+ `-wash`); data ramp `--data-1 … --data-6`;
  `--on-text` for text on a brand fill.
- **Elevation:** `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md` (Meridian adds `--shadow-lg`, used for overlays only).
- **Motion:** `--ease-out`, `--ease-standard`, `--dur-fast|base|slow`.

##### Component classes

- **Surface:** `.card`.
- **Buttons:** `.btn` + `.btn-primary` (one per view), `.btn-outline`, `.btn-ghost`, `.btn-danger`,
  `.btn-sm`. Bare `<button>` is already styled.
- **Inputs:** `.input`, `.input-mono`, `.toggle` (checkbox switch). Bare `<input>`/`<select>`/`<textarea>`
  are already styled.
- **Indicators:** `.badge` (+ `.badge-accent`, `.badge-secondary`, `.badge-dashed`), `.dot`
  (+ `.dot-live`, `.dot-success`, `.dot-warning`, `.dot-danger`), `.spinner`,
  `.text-success|warning|danger`.
- **Data:** `.table`, `.bar-track` > `.bar-fill` (`.is-1 … .is-4` for data colors), `.legend-dot`.
- **Typography helpers:** `.eyebrow` (uppercase micro-label), `.lead`, `.muted`, `.subtle`, `.mono`,
  `.numeric` (tabular figures).
- **Signature — active-edge:** `.has-edge` marks a leading brand rule; add `.is-active` to flag the
  element the user has activated (switches the edge to the accent + wash). It means _state_, not
  decoration — only put it on something actually active.

Accessibility is built in: `:focus-visible` rings and `prefers-reduced-motion` are handled by the
template. Keep semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`) — see `ceh-web-frontend:make-ui-accessible`.

To restyle the whole app later: replace the project's `brand.css` with the other template's — the
shared token + class contract means markup does not change.

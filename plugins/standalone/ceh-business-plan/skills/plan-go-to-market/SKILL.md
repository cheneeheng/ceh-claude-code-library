  Load this skill when a business plan must say how the first customers are actually won: name the
  first ten, choose one channel, write the customer-facing press release and hard questions, design
  the first taste of value, do the channel arithmetic, and set a short pass-or-fail channel test.
  Trigger on "how do I get my first customers", "go-to-market plan", "launch plan", "how do we sell
  this", "which channel should we use", "nobody is signing up", "plan the launch", "customer
  acquisition", "where do I find customers", or when a plan lists five marketing channels and
  commits to none. Not for search visibility (use ceh-seo), not for writing the launch post (use
  ceh-blog:draft-post), and not for deciding which segment to serve (use
  ceh-business-plan:sharpen-strategy).

# Plan go-to-market

Turn "we will market it" into a named list of first customers, one channel, and a test with a
number that decides whether to continue. Done is a §09 in `BUSINESS_PLAN.md` a founder could start
executing tomorrow morning, and a channel test scheduled in §13.

## Procedure

1. Read the plan, schema in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/business-plan-schema.md`. Take the
   segment from §03 and the price and acquisition ceiling from §08.
2. Name the first ten customers. Real names or accounts where the user has them. Otherwise the
   exact list they come from: a directory, a community, a conference attendee list, a street. A
   segment description is not a list.
3. Find uncontested ground. Ask where these customers are that larger rivals find unprofitable or
   beneath them to serve. Sam Walton opened in small towns the big chains skipped and was
   established before they noticed.
4. Write the working-backwards page: a one-paragraph press release in the customer's own words,
   then the five hardest questions that customer would ask and the answers. (Amazon's practice
   under Jeff Bezos.) A dull release means the offer is dull. Fix the offer, not the wording.
5. Design the first taste. State how a customer experiences the value before paying or before any
   effort. Estée Lauder put the product on the customer's hand and gave samples away. Name the
   equivalent here: a free first job, a live demo on their data, a trial, a result delivered by
   hand.
6. Choose one channel using the table below. Start with selling by hand, founder to customer,
   until the pitch converts. Things that do not scale come first because they are how the pitch
   gets learned.
7. Do the channel arithmetic: people reached, share who respond, share who buy, cost and hours
   spent. The result is a cost per customer. Compare it with the ceiling from §08.
8. Look for the loop: what does each customer make cheaper or easier about winning the next?
   Referral, content they create, data that improves the product, lower prices from scale. If
   there is none, say the growth is linear and budget for it.
9. Set the channel test: two to four weeks, one number that means pass, and the next channel to
   try on a fail.
10. Name the one adjacent segment that follows the beachhead and what must be true before moving
    to it. Do not plan beyond that.
11. Ask about the weakest step, one question per turn. Then write §09, put the test in §10 and
    §13, and re-score criteria 2 and 7 of the PMF gate.

## Choosing the channel

| Channel type        | Fits when                                                        | First test                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct, by hand     | High price, few customers, each reachable by name                | Contact 30 on the list, count conversations         |
| Community           | Customers already gather somewhere and help each other           | Answer questions there for two weeks, count replies |
| Content and search  | Customers search for the problem in words you can name           | One page on the exact query, count qualified visits |
| Partner or reseller | Someone already sells to this customer and gains by adding you   | One partner, one joint offer, count introductions   |
| Paid                | Unit economics are known and the payback is short                | Small fixed budget, count cost per paying customer  |
| Product-led         | The product shows its value in minutes with no one explaining it | Count signups that reach the first result unaided   |

A channel fits when the customer is already there and the cost per customer sits under the ceiling.
Pick the one that passes both, and write down why the others were declined.

## Rules

- One channel until it works or fails its test. Several half-run channels teach nothing about any
  of them.
- People before populations. Push every "small businesses" to "name one".
- The founder sells first. Hiring sales or buying ads before the pitch converts by hand pays to
  scale a message that does not work.
- Never invent a customer name, a community, a conversion rate, or a list. Unknowns go in as
  `[assumption]` with the way to find out.
- Record what customers say word for word. Their phrasing becomes the press release and the page
  headline.
- A cost per customer above the §08 ceiling is a finding to report, not a number to tune until it
  fits.

## Output

Written into §09 of `BUSINESS_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
### First ten

| #   | Name or source list | Why them | How reached | Status |
| --- | ------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------ |

### Press release and questions

<one paragraph, customer's words>

1. <hardest customer question> — <answer>

### First taste

<what the customer gets before paying, and what it costs to give>

### Channel: <one>

- Why this one: <customer is already there because ...>
- Arithmetic: <reached> x <respond %> x <buy %> = <customers>, cost <amount> = <per customer>
- Ceiling from §08: <amount> — <under | over>
- Declined: <channel> because <reason>

### Loop

<what each customer makes easier about the next, or "none, growth is linear">

### Channel test

<dates>, pass at <number>, on fail try <next channel>

### Next segment

<segment>, only after <condition>
```

## Stop conditions

- The user cannot name a single candidate customer or the list they come from → stop. The segment
  is not yet real. Name `ceh-business-plan:develop-business-plan`.
- Every plausible channel costs more than the §08 ceiling → report that the business cannot reach
  its customers at this price, with the gap in money per customer.

## Hands off to

- When §08 has no acquisition ceiling, suggest `ceh-business-plan:stress-test-unit-economics`
  first.
- When the channel test is set, suggest `ceh-business-plan:set-operating-plan` to give it an owner
  and a weekly number.

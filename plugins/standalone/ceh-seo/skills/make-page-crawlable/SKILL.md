  Load this skill when shipping or creating a public-facing web page or route: a landing page,
  marketing page, docs site, blog page, or any HTML surface that crawlers and AI engines will see.
  Trigger on "add SEO", "make this page discoverable", "meta tags", "open graph", "structured data",
  "sitemap", "robots.txt", or when a new public route is created in a SvelteKit or React app. Not
  for README, package-listing, or repo text (use ceh-seo:pitch-project), not for authoring
  the llms.txt file itself (use ceh-seo:write-llms-txt), and not for writing the page's content
  itself (use ceh-blog).

# Web discoverability

A public page is not done until its discoverability surface is complete. Search engines and
generative engines both work from the same raw material: the initial HTML response, the head
metadata, and sentences that survive being quoted out of context. Ship all three with the page,
not as a later "SEO pass".

## Procedure

1. Complete the per-page head. Every indexable page ships with:
   - **`<title>`** — unique per page, ≤ 60 characters, page-specific words first, site name last
     (`Pricing — Acme`, not `Acme | Home of the best...`).
   - **Meta description** — ≤ 155 characters, stating the answer or value, not a teaser. This is
     the excerpt search results and AI engines show; write it as the sentence you want quoted.
   - **Canonical link** — exactly one per page. Required wherever the same content is reachable
     under multiple URLs (trailing slash, query params, www).
   - **Open Graph + Twitter card** — `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` (1200×630),
     `og:type`; `twitter:card` = `summary_large_image`. Every shared link renders through these.
     The `og:image` file must actually exist and be a real 1200×630 PNG or JPG — link-preview
     crawlers render SVG inconsistently, and a dangling image reference silently kills every
     share card.
   - **Robots meta only to exclude** — `noindex` on thin, duplicate, or gated pages. Absence
     means index; never add an empty or permissive robots meta out of habit.
   - **No `<meta keywords>`** — dead surface; adding it only signals template cargo-culting.
2. Cover the site-level surfaces:
   - **`sitemap.xml`** — canonical URLs only, referenced from `robots.txt`.
   - **`robots.txt`** — allow by default; block only genuinely private paths. Blocking AI
     crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot) is a product decision, not a default — flag it
     to the user rather than deciding either way silently.
   - **`llms.txt`** at the site root — a curated markdown reading list for AI agents, shipped
     alongside the sitemap and kept current as public pages change. `ceh-seo:write-llms-txt` owns
     its format and curation.
   - **404s return HTTP 404.** An SPA fallback serving every unknown path as 200 poisons the
     index with phantom pages.
   - **Moved pages get a 301** at the server/adapter level — no redirect chains, no client-side
     `window.location` redirects.
3. Add structured data:
   - JSON-LD in a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block — never microdata attributes.
   - Match the type to the page: `WebSite` + `Organization` on the home page,
     `Article`/`BlogPosting` on posts, `SoftwareApplication` or `Product` on product pages,
     `FAQPage` on FAQ content.
   - Only mark up content actually visible on the page — invisible structured data is a
     penalty surface, not a bonus.
4. Check rendering:
   - **Content must be in the initial HTML response.** Most AI crawlers do not execute
     JavaScript, and search rendering is deferred and unreliable. A client-only SPA page is
     invisible to the engines this skill exists for.
   - SvelteKit: `export const prerender = true` on static public routes; SSR for dynamic ones.
   - React + Vite: public pages need a prerender/SSG pass — a bare client-side SPA is not a
     discoverable page, whatever its meta tags say.
5. Write the page text for citation by generative engines (GEO):
   - **Answer-first sections.** Open each section with the claim; elaborate after. Engines quote
     sentences, not pages — a section whose first sentence is throat-clearing gets skipped.
   - **Extractable facts.** State facts in standalone sentences that survive quoting alone
     ("X supports Y since v2.1"), with concrete numbers over adjectives.
   - **Question-shaped headings** for question-shaped content — the heading is the query the
     engine matches against.

## Rules

- No keyword stuffing, hidden text, or doorway pages — engines derank all three.
- No SEO library or framework plugin for what static head tags do — a `<svelte:head>` or
  React helmet-equivalent block is a few lines.
- Never trade accessibility for SEO. Semantic headings, landmarks, and alt text serve both;
  when they appear to conflict, accessibility wins.

  Load this skill when deciding which inputs and scenarios a test should cover, not how to wire the
  runner. Supplies the input-selection ladder: equivalence partitions, boundaries, decision tables,
  state transitions, pairwise, property-based tests, metamorphic relations, fuzzing, and forced
  failure of every dependency. Trigger on "write tests for this", "what should I test", "cover the
  edge cases", "property-based", or when a test file has only a happy path. Pairs with the stack
  testing skills, which own the runner, fixtures, and mocking library.

# Design Test Cases

The runner, fixtures, and mocking library belong to your stack's testing skill
(`ceh-python-service:write-pytest-service-tests`, `ceh-python-library:write-pytest-library-tests`,
`ceh-web-frontend:write-vitest-playwright-tests`). This skill answers the question those do not: **which inputs,
and which scenarios.**

## Two failure modes, not one

- **Too few:** one happy path plus a null check. Passes on code that is wrong in every way a real
  caller will discover.
- **Too many:** thirty variations of the same equivalence class, a reference implementation written
  in the test file to check the function against, a performance budget nobody asked for. Volume
  reads as diligence and is not — it is the same coverage at several times the maintenance cost,
  and each redundant test is another thing that breaks on a legitimate change.

The second is the one you are more likely to produce. The ladder below exists as much to tell you
**where to stop** as where to start.

## Procedure

Walk the ladder in order. **Each rung has a trigger; if the trigger is absent, skip the rung and say so.**
Most functions need 1, 2, and 6 — reaching rung 7 or 9 on a pure helper is over-testing, not thoroughness.

| Rung                 | Trigger — reach for it only when                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Partitions         | always                                              |
| 2 Boundaries         | always                                              |
| 3 Decision table     | two or more flags/enums combine to pick the outcome |
| 4 State transitions  | the thing has a lifecycle                           |
| 5 Pairwise           | the config grid exceeds ~8 live rows                |
| 6 Properties         | the function is pure and total                      |
| 7 Metamorphic        | no expected output can be written down              |
| 8 Fuzzing            | the input is attacker- or user-controlled           |
| 9 Dependency failure | the code calls something that can fail              |

### 1. Partition the input space

Group inputs into classes where every member takes the same path. **One test per class, not per
value.** Three tests for `5`, `7`, and `12` are one test wearing three hats — delete two.

For `discount(order_total, customer_tier)` the classes are tier values × {below, at, above
threshold} — not a list of amounts.

Write the classes down before the tests. If you cannot name a class's expected behavior in a
sentence, you do not yet understand the requirement.

### 2. Boundaries — where the bugs actually are

Test **the boundary and one step either side**, never the middle of a range. Run this checklist
against every parameter, and take only the rows that apply:

| Kind       | Cases                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Numeric    | `0`, `1`, `-1`, min, min−1, max, max+1, the exact threshold and threshold±1                                                   |
| Collection | empty, exactly one, exactly two, at the size limit, over the limit, duplicates, unsorted                                      |
| String     | `""`, whitespace-only, single char, at max length, over max length, unicode + emoji, embedded newline, leading/trailing space |
| Optional   | absent, present-but-null, present-but-empty — these are three different inputs                                                |
| Time       | epoch, DST transition, month/year end, leap day, expiry exactly now, timezone-naive vs aware                                  |
| Pagination | page 0, page 1, last page, page past the end, limit 0, limit above max                                                        |

"At the limit" and "one over the limit" are the two highest-yield cases in the table. Include them
whenever a limit exists; a row whose kind is not in the signature is not a gap.

### 3. Decision tables — when flags interact

Enumerate the grid, strike the impossible rows, test what remains:

| `is_member` | `has_coupon` | `cart ≥ $50` | Expected                    |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| F           | F            | F            | no discount                 |
| F           | F            | T            | free shipping               |
| F           | T            | F            | coupon only                 |
| T           | F            | T            | member rate + free shipping |
| …           |              |              |                             |

This is how you find the combination nobody implemented — the highest-yield rung against real
feature code, and the one least likely to be reached without being prompted. If the grid exceeds
~8 live rows, go to rung 5.

### 4. State transitions — including the illegal ones

Anything with a lifecycle (order, session, job, connection, feature flag). Test the legal path
once, then spend your effort on:

- **Invalid transitions** — cancel an already-shipped order, pay a refunded invoice, close a closed
  connection. These are where real systems corrupt data.
- **Repeat transitions** — fire the same valid transition twice. Idempotent, or a duplicate charge?
- **Terminal states** — every operation attempted after the terminal state.

### 5. Pairwise — when the config space explodes

Six independent booleans is 64 combinations; nobody writes 64 tests, so most people write two.
Covering all _pairs_ catches the large majority of interaction bugs in a fraction of the cases.
Generate the set (`allpairspy` in Python, a table in TS) rather than picking by hand — hand-picked
sets cluster around the defaults, which is exactly where bugs are not.

### 6. Properties — rules that hold for every input

When you can state a rule that must always be true, assert the **rule** instead of guessing inputs
(`hypothesis` in Python, `fast-check` in TS). The generator picks inputs your imagination would not,
and shrinks a failure to a minimal case.

| Shape       | Assertion                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Round-trip  | `decode(encode(x)) == x`, parse∘format, serialize∘deserialize              |
| Invariant   | output always sorted / length preserved / total unchanged / never negative |
| Idempotence | `f(f(x)) == f(x)` — normalizers, migrations, retries, upserts              |
| Oracle      | matches a slow-but-obviously-correct reference, or the old implementation  |

Reach for this whenever a function is pure and total: parsers, formatters, serializers, sorting,
money and date arithmetic, sanitizers, diffing, pagination math.

One property replaces a dozen example tests — delete the examples it subsumes, keeping only the
boundary cases from rung 2. Do **not** write an oracle by re-implementing the function in the test
file unless a genuinely independent reference already exists: a re-implementation shares your
misreading of the spec and doubles what has to change when the spec moves.

Record any failing case the generator finds as its own explicit test — generators are not
guaranteed to produce it again.

### 7. Metamorphic relations — when there is no expected output

Rung 6 needs you to know what the answer should be. Search ranking, recommendations, LLM output,
pricing engines with a hundred rules, image and audio processing, simulations, aggregation
pipelines — for these nobody can write the expected value down, so they end up tested with one
snapshot and a hope.

Assert instead how the output must **change when the input changes**. You never need to know the
answer, only the relationship:

| Relation                       | Example                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Permutation invariance         | reordering the query terms must not change the result set                                                           |
| Monotonicity                   | adding a matching document must not lower an existing document's rank; adding an item must not lower the cart total |
| Scaling / units                | prices in cents and in dollars must produce the same ordering; a resized image must classify the same               |
| Additivity                     | `total(a + b) == total(a) + total(b)` for a linear fee                                                              |
| Irrelevant-input insensitivity | appending whitespace, a trailing newline, or an unused field must not change the output                             |
| Consistency between paths      | the batch endpoint and N single calls must agree                                                                    |

These are the highest-value tests available for any component whose output you cannot predict, and
usually the only ones that survive a model or ruleset being swapped out.

### 8. Fuzz whatever parses untrusted input

Rung 6 asserts a rule; fuzzing asserts only that the code **does not crash, hang, or corrupt state**
on input nobody would think to write. That weak oracle is enough when the input is attacker- or
user-controlled: file uploads, request bodies, query strings, cookies, webhook payloads, config
files, protocol frames, anything `pickle`/`yaml.load`/`eval` touches.

Same generators as rung 6, with the widest strategy available (`st.binary()`, `st.text()`) and a
`try`/`except` that passes on the one error type callers handle and fails on everything else —
`MemoryError`, `IndexError`, a hang. Assert the failure **mode**, not just the absence of failure:
a rejected input must leave no partial write, no unbounded allocation, and no unclosed handle.

Sustained fuzzing of a native or long-lived parser is `atheris` / `libFuzzer` territory — a decision
to raise, not to make silently.

### 9. Force every dependency to fail

Mocks that only ever return success leave every `except` / `catch` branch unexecuted. This is the
most under-tested region of agent-written code, and it is skipped far more often than it is
overdone.

For each external dependency, make it fail once: raises the library's real exception type (not bare
`Exception`), times out, returns a malformed / empty / partial payload, returns success with a field
missing, and fails **after** a partial write. In every case assert the state left behind, not only
that the call raised — `order.status == "pending"` is the assertion that catches the real bug.

## Rules

### Assertion rules

- **Assert the value, not its existence.** `assert result is not None` and
  `expect(x).toBeDefined()` pass on almost every bug. Assert the actual expected value.
- **Use a literal expected value.** If the test computes the expectation with the same logic as the
  code, it will agree with the code no matter how wrong both are. Write `timedelta(minutes=90)`,
  not `parse_duration_reference("1h30m")`.
- **One behavior per test.** The failure message should name the bug without a debugger.
- **Assert the state change too**, not only the return value — what got written, what got emitted.

### How many tests is enough

Not a coverage percentage. Coverage tells you which lines ran, never whether an assertion would
have noticed them being wrong.

The suite is sufficient when: **every partition once, every boundary once, every live decision-table
row once, every invalid transition once, every dependency-failure path once.** Anything short of
that is a gap you can name. Anything past it is duplication — and duplication is a defect, not a
safety margin, so cut it before you hand the suite over.

Say which rungs you skipped and why. A test file that states "no lifecycle, so no rung 4; grid is
2 rows, so no pairwise" is reviewable; one that silently covers everything is not.

To find out whether those tests would actually catch a defect, use `ceh-testing:audit-test-suite`.

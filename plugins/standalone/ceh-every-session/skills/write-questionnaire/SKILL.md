  Load this skill when open questions must go to someone who is not in the session: turn them into
  a self-contained questionnaire file another person answers later, then read the answers back and
  continue. Each question carries its context, options with a recommended default, and what it
  blocks. Trigger on "write these up as questions for X", "make a questionnaire", "I need to ask
  the team", "send these questions to the client", "read the answers back". Not for asking the user
  in this session (use AskUserQuestion).

# Write questionnaire

Turn open questions into one file that someone who never saw this session can answer cold, and
read their answers back into the work. Done means the file is written and its path reported, or,
in read mode, every answer is applied or listed as still open.

## Procedure

### Write

1. **Collect the open questions** from the session: decisions you deferred, facts you could not
   find, choices only the reader owns. Drop any you can answer yourself from the files or a
   sensible default the reader would not care about.
2. **Order them by what they block**, most first. A question nothing waits on goes last or goes.
3. **Write each question self-contained** in the format under Output. The reader has none of this
   session's context, so each question carries the facts needed to answer it, in plain words, with
   no session jargon or file paths the reader cannot open.
4. **Give options where the answer is a choice**, each with its consequence, and mark the one you
   recommend. A free-text question still states what form of answer you can use.
5. **Save** to `.agents_workspace/questionnaires/<YYYYMMDD>-<topic>.md` in the working directory,
   creating the directory if needed, and report the path and the question count.

### Read

1. **Find the file**: the path given, otherwise the newest file in
   `.agents_workspace/questionnaires/`.
2. **Read every `Answer:` line.** Apply each answer to the work it unblocks, in question order.
3. **List what is still open**: blank answers, and answers that raise a new question. A blank
   answer does not mean the recommended default: say which default you would take and wait.

## Rules

- One question per entry. "Should we use X, and if so how should Y work?" is two questions.
- Ask for the decision, not for permission to think. "Which of A or B?" beats "Any thoughts on
  the design?", which returns an essay instead of an answer.
- Ten questions at most. Past that, the reader skims, so cut to the ten that block the most work.
- Writing the file sends nothing. Delivering it to the reader (email, chat, a ticket) is the
  user's step unless they asked you to do it.

## Output

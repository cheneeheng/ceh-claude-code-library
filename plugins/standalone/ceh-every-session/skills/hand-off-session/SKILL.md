  Load this skill when a session's working state must survive into a later session: save writes a
  handoff file (goal, done, in flight, open, decisions pending, resume line) and indexes it, load
  reads one back and resumes from its first open step. Trigger on "save the session", "save where
  we are", "write a handoff", "I'll continue this tomorrow", "load the handoff", "pick this up",
  "resume from the handoff". Not for the usage-limit stop protocol (ceh-every-session:usage-limit-handoff
  calls this skill itself).

# Hand off session

Save turns this session's working state into one file a later session can resume from cold. Load
reads that file back and continues from it. The file replaces the transcript: everything needed is
in context _now_, and reconstructing it later from a transcript costs far more than writing it.

Pick the mode from `$ARGUMENTS` or the request: `save` when the state must outlive the session,
`load` when a new session starts from one. With no clear mode, saving is the default, because a
spare handoff file costs nothing and a missing one loses the state.

## Save

1. **Leave nothing half-applied.** Finish the edit or command in flight, or revert it and record it
   as open. Do not start new work to make the snapshot look tidier.
2. **Describe the working tree, do not change it.** Commit uncommitted changes only if committing
   was already authorized. Saving a handoff authorizes no commit, stash, or push.
3. **Write the handoff file** to
   `.agents_workspace/handoff/HANDOFF-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>-<session-id-prefix>.md` in the working
   directory, in the format under Output. Create the directory if needed. Take the timestamp from
   a single `date` call and the session id prefix from the first 8 characters of
   `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`. A caller that passes its own header lines (a usage window, a reason)
   gets them added under the title.
4. **Append one line to the global index** at `~/.claude/handoff/index.md`, creating it if absent:
   `- <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <cwd> — <branch or "no git"> — <one-line state> — <file path>`.
   The index is what finds the file days later without remembering which directory it was in.
5. **Report the file path and its content** as your message, so the handoff is readable without
   opening the file.

Saving does not end the session. Keep working afterwards if the user asks, and save again later:
each save is a new file, never an edit of an old one.

## Load

1. **Find the file.** Use the path given. Otherwise take the newest `HANDOFF-*.md` in
   `.agents_workspace/handoff/`, and if there is none, the newest index line in
   `~/.claude/handoff/index.md` whose cwd matches. If several plausible files exist and none was
   named, list the newest few with their one-line state and take the newest, saying so.
2. **Read it in full**, then check it against the world before trusting it: the branch exists and
   is checked out, files named under Done exist, `git log` and `git status` match the described
   state. Report every mismatch. The file is a snapshot and the repo may have moved on.
3. **State what you are resuming:** the goal, and the first Open item as the next step.
4. **Continue from the first Open item.** A Decisions pending entry that blocks that step goes to
   the user before any work on it.

## Rules

- Write for a reader with none of this context: exact file paths, branch names, commands. A line
  that only makes sense with the transcript open is a line to rewrite.
- Keep the file a bounded snapshot, short enough to read in full on load, never a log.
- Mark what was validated and what was not. Load treats an unmarked Done item as unverified.
- Resume by loading the file in a fresh session, not by replaying the old one with `--resume`.
  The replay pays again for the context the file exists to compress.

## Output

```markdown
# Handoff — <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>

**Repo / branch:** <path> / <branch or "no git">
**Session:** <session-id-prefix>

**Goal** — what this session set out to do:

- <one or two lines>

**Done** — completed and in what state (validated / not validated):

- <item — files touched, what was verified>

**In flight** — the step closed or reverted at the save:

- <state of the working tree, anything half-planned>

**Open** — remaining work, ordered; first item is the next actionable step:

1. <next concrete step, specific enough to execute cold>
2. <...>

**Decisions pending** — forks the user still has to resolve, if any.

**Resume with:** <one line: branch name, command to run, or file to open first>
```

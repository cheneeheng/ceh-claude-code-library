# Blog draft

Turn whatever the author has into one complete, publishable draft in their personal voice. The
input decides the route: a repo or bare topic gets an interview first, rich notes get drafted
immediately. Done means a full post with a title, body, and meta description, ending on its open
thread, saved or shown where the Output section says.

## Procedure

### 1. Read the blog first (series awareness)

Read the blog, not just the repo, before the first question or the first word of the draft.
**Finding the blog:** use a path or URL the user gave; otherwise look in the current repo for a
posts directory (`content/`, `posts/`, `_posts/`, `src/content/`, `blog/`); if neither turns one
up, ask once where the blog lives. "No existing blog" is a valid answer and skips this step.

Read the previous posts, especially the latest episode in the same series. Then:

- **Pick up the thread**: if the last post ended on a live thread, open with it ("Last time I
  said…") and cross-link it. When interviewing, ask _"the last post ended on X — is this the post
  that answers it?"_
- **Pin chronology**: if the material does not say when this happened relative to the last post,
  ask one timestamp question. It prevents continuity bugs (wrong versions, events out of order).
- **Check continuity facts** against earlier episodes: versions, dates, what the reader already
  knows. Don't re-tell a story a previous episode owns — call back in a sentence and link.
- **Leave a thread**: plan what this episode leaves open. Closure instead if the series is
  finished.

### 2. Read the material and pick the route

Read everything provided before doing anything else, then follow the matching route.

**A repo or code artefact** (GitHub URL, local path, pasted README or file contents): read it
before asking anything.

- **GitHub URL**: fetch the README with `WebFetch` (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/main/README.md`, `master` if `main` fails), or with `gh repo view {owner}/{repo}` when `gh` is available — the only route that works for a private repo. Browse key files if needed (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, main entry point).
- **Local path**: `Glob` the top two levels, `Read` the README (or `.rst`/`.txt`), then key manifests and entry points for stack and structure.
- **Pasted content**: read it directly.

Infer without asking: **what it does** (README, module names, entry points); **who it's for**
(docs, example usage); **stack and key design decisions** (structure, dependencies); **current
state** (finished tool, experiment, WIP?). A repo usually supports several post types, so surface
only the angles that fit:

> _"I've read through the repo. There are a few directions this post could go:_
> _- **Launch/showcase** — what it is, why you built it, how to use it_
> _- **Tutorial/How-To** — walk readers through building something similar_
> _- **Lessons Learned** — what you discovered, what surprised you, what you'd do differently_
>
> _Which resonates, or is there a different angle you have in mind?"_

If the repo can support multiple posts (complex system, long build journey, multiple use patterns),
flag it: _"This project has enough depth for a short series — e.g. an intro post now, a deep-dive
into [key decision] later, a retrospective once it's been out a while. One post to start, or plan
a series?"_ For a series, plan the arc first (which post covers what), then one post at a time.

**Notes, bullets, an outline, or fragments**: assess completeness.

- **Rich material**: multiple specifics, a clear arc or argument. Draft immediately.
- **Workable but sparse**: angle clear, some detail thin. Draft, and flag the gaps in the refinement offer rather than asking upfront.
- **Genuinely incomplete**: a topic with no substance — no story, steps, or argument. The one case warranting a single question before drafting, the one that unlocks the most (e.g. "What was the moment this actually became a problem?"). Then draft without further questions.

**Only a topic, idea, or experience** (verbal prompt, nothing written): infer **topic**, **post
type**, **audience**, **goal** (credibility, lesson, traffic, entertainment, announcement), and
**length/tone**. If genuinely uninferable, ask **one** question that unlocks the most — usually
_"Who are you writing this for and what do you want them to take away?"_ Then interview (step 3).

### 3. Interview for what is missing

Skip this step when the material is rich or the route was notes. Otherwise extract the **specific
raw material** that makes the post real: stories, data points, moments, opinions, decisions. Only
ask what you haven't inferred, and adapt to the post type. From a repo, the repo gives the _what_,
so interview for the **human story**, 2–3 of these, only what the repo hasn't answered:

- Why build this instead of using an existing tool?
- Hardest decision while building it?
- What are you most proud of that nobody will notice?
- What would you do differently starting over?
- A specific user, problem, or moment that sparked it?

**For any post:** the single most important thing the reader should walk away knowing or feeling;
the most surprising or counterintuitive thing about the topic; a specific moment, decision, or
event the post is really about.

**The four story beats** are required for story-voice posts (Lessons Learned, Personal Story, most
Launch and Opinion). Facts are not enough. Ask one at a time, skipping any the user already gave:

1. **The turn** — what happened between not-knowing and knowing? How did the realization arrive?
2. **The moment** — your reaction when it happened?
3. **The verdict** — the honest current state; allowed to be unresolved or reserved.
4. **The thread** — what question is still open? (This becomes the post's ending.)

**By post type:**

- **Lessons Learned / Story**: what actually happened, in order; the mistake, turning point, or key decision; what you got wrong at first and what changed your mind; what you'd do differently.
- **How-To**: the most common mistake; the step most tutorials leave out; the thing you wish someone had told you. **Ask for real commands, config, or file contents** — if a step is described abstractly, ask _"What does that actually look like in code / config / command?"_
- **Opinion / Thought Leadership**: the view you're arguing against (named explicitly); the evidence or experience that changed your thinking; the most credible counter-argument and why you're still right. **Watch for rant drift**: abstractions ("companies always do X") are the first sign — replace with named instances.
- **Project / Launch**: what problem, for whom; the hardest thing to build or decide; the thing you're most proud of that no one will notice.

**Tone:** technical and professional posts (How-To, Launch, Opinion) get direct questions for
specifics, numbers, and decisions. Emotionally weighted topics (burnout, failure, grief,
setbacks) open with curiosity, not diagnosis — "what was that like", not "what went wrong" —
and ask for specifics once the author is in the story.

**Interview rules:**

1. **One question per turn.** Wait for the answer.
2. Follow up on vague or abstract answers: _"Can you give me a specific example?"_
3. **Offer hypothesis options when you can form plausible guesses.** Instead of _"How did you figure it out?"_: _"Did Claude critique it, did you read something, or did it crystallize on its own?"_ Correcting a concrete guess is easier than composing from scratch and gets a sharper reply. Ask open questions when you have no good hypotheses.
4. **Handle answer drift**: if the user answers a different question than asked, keep the answer — it's real material. Decide whether the original beat is still needed; if so, re-ask **once at most**, rephrased. Don't interrogate.
5. **Store quotable phrasing verbatim** as it arrives, and mark the lines to use nearly word-for-word.
6. **If the first message already has strong specifics** (real numbers, named events, clear arc), draft after one confirming question — don't manufacture exchanges. The goal is a great post, not a thorough interview.
7. When you have enough (typically 2–5 exchanges, sometimes 1), say so and draft. For story-voice posts, "enough" includes the four beats, or an explicit note that a beat is missing, never an invented one.
8. If a tangent is more interesting than the stated topic: _"This angle — [X] — might be more compelling than [original]. Explore that instead?"_

### 4. Draft the post

Produce a complete draft — not an outline, not a bullet summary.

- **Title**: sharp, specific, honest. No clickbait, no vague "My Thoughts on X". Aim for: _specific claim + implicit promise to reader_.
- **Opening**: inside a moment or a thought within the first 2 sentences — not background, not a product pitch.
- **Body**: match structure to post type (below). Use the user's own words and specifics — quotable interview lines go in nearly verbatim, and real details are not paraphrased into abstractions.
- **Closing**: the open thread (see Voice). No "I hope this was helpful", no manufactured takeaway, lesson, or CTA.
- **Length**: what the content needs, not the length of the source material — don't pad, don't cut substance.
  - Opinion / Personal Story / Thought Leadership: 400–800 words. Tight is better.
  - Lessons Learned / Launch: 600–1,000 words.
  - How-To / Tutorial: 800–1,800 words, driven by steps and code samples — no ceiling if genuinely required.

**Post types:**

| Type                   | Trigger signals                                                          | What it needs                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lessons Learned**    | "I tried X", "we built Y", "I made a mistake", a story ending in insight | Story arc: situation → problem → decision → outcome → insight |
| **How-To / Tutorial**  | "how to do X", "step-by-step", commands, config snippets                 | Concrete steps, actual commands/examples, pitfalls            |
| **Opinion / Take**     | "I think X is wrong", "here's my hot take", a stated position            | Clear thesis, 2–3 arguments, counter-argument addressed       |
| **Project / Launch**   | "I shipped X", "we launched", feature descriptions                       | What it does, why it matters, what was hard, what's next      |
| **Thought Leadership** | "my view on [trend/industry]"                                            | Unique insight backed by evidence, non-obvious conclusion     |
| **Personal Story**     | "something happened to me", "my journey"                                 | Emotional arc, honest detail, why the reader should care      |

**Structure by post type.** Every template ends on **the open thread** (defined in Voice).

**Lessons Learned:**

```
Hook: The moment it went wrong (or right)
Setup: Context — what were you trying to do?
The Story: What happened, in order
The Turn: When/where things changed
The Insight: What you actually learned (be specific)
The Open Thread: What's unresolved, what you'll watch for, what comes next
```

**How-To:**

```
Hook: The moment this became a problem for you / what it cost you
Overview: What we're doing and why this approach
Steps: Numbered, concrete, with real examples
Pitfalls: What they cost you — narrated as your experience, not warnings issued to the reader
The Open Thread: Where this leaves you — what's still rough, what you're watching for
```

**Opinion / Take:**

```
Hook: State the controversial or non-obvious thesis upfront
Argument 1: [strongest point]
Argument 2: [second point]
Counter-argument: What the other side would say — and why you're still right
The Open Thread: Where you actually land — a reserved verdict is valid; what would change your mind
```

**Project / Launch:**

```
Hook: The moment that led to building it (a scene or a thought), with what it does and who it's for inside the first paragraph
The Origin: Why you built this — what was missing, what frustrated you, why existing tools didn't cut it
How It Works: The interesting parts only — architecture, key decisions, not a feature list
What Was Hard: Be honest — one real technical or design challenge
The Open Thread: What's unresolved, what you're watching for, what comes next
```

**Thought Leadership:**

```
Hook: State the non-obvious claim or question upfront — don't bury the thesis
Argument: Build through specific examples, not abstract assertions (name real products, companies, events)
Counter-argument: The strongest objection — acknowledge it directly, then explain why the thesis holds
Implication: What changes if this view holds? (concrete, not vague)
The Open Thread: What's still unresolved in your own thinking — what you'll watch for next
```

**Personal Story:**

```
Hook: The specific moment this post is really about — one concrete scene, not a summary
Setup: Enough context to understand what was at stake (brief)
Arc: What happened, what changed, what the turning point was
The Insight: What you actually learned — specific, not "I learned resilience"
The Open Thread: What's unresolved, what you'll watch for, what comes next
```

### 5. Refine

After sharing the draft, ask: _"What's landing well and what feels off?"_ Also offer **one
proactive observation** — something you'd fix even if they're happy. Watch for and raise:

- **Opening too slow**: first paragraph is setup, not a moment — offer an alternative opening.
- **Missing the specific**: draft generalizes where the material or interview has real numbers, names, or moments — insert them.
- **Wrong angle**: post reads for practitioners but the audience is beginners (or vice versa).
- **Conclusion fizzles or lectures**: ending restates the intro, trails off, or lands on a tidy takeaway or CTA — replace with the genuinely open thread or a reserved verdict.
- **Influencer tells**: any banned tell present — rewrite quieter, per Voice.
- **Continuity slip**: a version, date, or fact contradicts an earlier episode — fix against the previous posts.
- **Paraphrased voice**: a quotable line got smoothed into generic prose — restore the user's phrasing.
- **Generic title**: could describe dozens of posts — push for a specific claim or hook.
- **Tone mismatch**: source casual, draft formal (or vice versa) — ask if they want the voice adjusted.
- **Gaps flagged earlier**: surface thin spots as concrete invitations: _"The pitfalls section would be stronger with a real example — do you have one?"_

If the user wants a different angle or structure, **re-draft** — a revision that fights the original structure reads like a revision.

## Rules

### Voice

Personal voice, not influencer style — the reader overhears the reasoning, not a lecture. If the
target repo's `CLAUDE.md` defines a blog voice, it overrides every structure template above.

**Prefer:** first person, grounded in what actually happened and was thought; connected
paragraphs that carry the narrative — reflective, not prescriptive; doubt and self-report kept in
("I shipped it anyway, because I was tired of this bug"); quieter is better; open inside a moment
or a thought — an annoyance, a realization, a scene — never a product pitch or background.

**Banned tells:** punchy standalone one-liner paragraphs; aphoristic closers ("The boring choice
is the correct one"); imperative lessons aimed at the reader ("Don't design your own. Surface
theirs."); "If you're building X, then Y" prescriptions; bold pseudo-headers as section labels
("**What it does**", "**The lesson:**"); tidy meta-takeaway sign-offs that turn a personal story
into a lecture; CTA endings.

**Never invent scenes, feelings, or chronology.** Every beat comes from the material (changelogs,
specs, commits) or the author's own words — quote those nearly verbatim; the phrasing _is_ the
voice. If a human beat is missing, flag the gap instead of fabricating it.

**Endings — the open thread:** the honest current state — what's unresolved, what you'll watch
for, what comes next. A reserved verdict ("I'm keeping it, for now") is valid. Only a finished
series' final post ends with closure — no manufactured cliffhangers. Never a tidy takeaway,
lesson, or CTA.

**Series:** the blog is serials — each project a series, each post an episode the reader follows
in order (see step 1).

**Tutorials** keep full utility — real code, steps, pitfalls — but pitfalls are narrated as what
they cost the author, not warnings issued to the reader.

### Working principles

- **Infer first, ask second**: extract everything the user has already said, and only ask what you genuinely can't infer.
- **At most one question at a time**: never dump a list, because a list lets the author answer the easy items and skip the one that unlocks the post. Ask the single most important thing you don't yet know. Notes with a workable angle get zero questions.
- **Read everything before writing anything**: full material first, identify the angle, then one complete draft.
- **Pick the strongest thread**: if the material sprawls, choose the sharpest angle rather than covering everything, and tell the user which thread you picked and why.
- **Concrete over abstract**: push for specifics — real numbers, actual events, named people, exact moments.
- **Use the user's words**: pull real phrases, specifics, and examples from the material and the interview. A usable line ("first impression is a lot cleaner and smooth") goes into the draft nearly word-for-word.

### Edge cases

- **Wall of notes with multiple threads**: pick the strongest one — don't weave. Tell the user, then draft immediately without asking permission: _"Your notes cover a few directions. I've written about [angle X] because [reason]. If you'd rather have [angle Y], I'll re-draft."_
- **Conflicting signals** (half story, half tutorial): pick the dominant signal and note the tension: _"Your notes mix story and tutorial. I've written this as a [type], which fits most of the material. If you want the other framing, I can re-draft."_
- **How-To with abstract steps**: if real commands, config, or code are missing, draft with what's there and flag it in the refinement offer (_"drop in actual commands and I'll weave them in"_). Don't ask upfront if the rest is strong enough.
- **No clear topic yet**: ask what they've been working on, thinking about, or frustrated by lately. The topic is in there.
- **Multiple posts wanted**: one at a time — complete the first interview and draft before starting the next.
- **Expert writing for beginners**: push them to explain jargon, add examples, and not skip "obvious" steps.
- **Listicle or generic SEO post**: write it well anyway, but flag a more compelling angle if one is hiding underneath.
- **No human to answer** (a headless run, or called by another agent): draft from the material you have and never invent a personal moment, quote, or number. Put a bracketed placeholder where each missing specific belongs (`[the moment you noticed X]`), mark the post as a draft, and end with the interview questions you would have asked, in order. With only a bare topic and no material, stop and report that the post needs the author's story.

## Output

**During an interview:** conversational, one question at a time, no lists, no preamble.

**Before drafting** (if noting thread selection or flagging a gap): one short paragraph, then the draft immediately.

**Final draft**: complete post, ready to copy-paste — title; body (subheadings only if length warrants); one-line meta description `> **Meta:** [description]` — ~150 chars, specific angle, readable without the title.

**Where it goes:** inside a blog repo (a posts directory was found), write the post as a new file there, matching the existing posts' filename pattern and front matter; the title and meta description go into the front matter fields the other posts use (`title`, `description`, or equivalent) instead of the `> **Meta:**` line. Mark it as a draft if the front matter has a draft flag. Otherwise output the draft in chat.

## Hands off to

- Once the user is satisfied, mention: _"When you're ready to share this, `/ceh-blog:repurpose-post` can adapt it into a Twitter/X thread, LinkedIn post, TL;DR, or newsletter blurb."_
- If the input turns out to be an existing prose draft rather than notes, offer `/ceh-blog:edit-post` instead of drafting over it.

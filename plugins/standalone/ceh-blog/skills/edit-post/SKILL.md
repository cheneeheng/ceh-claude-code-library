# Edit post

Diagnose an existing blog draft, then produce a full revised version that keeps the author's voice.
Done means a short diagnosis followed by the complete revision, with one question asked after.

## Procedure

### 1. Read the draft

Read the full draft before doing anything else, with no mid-read comments or questions. Note: post
type (Lessons Learned, How-To, Opinion, Launch, Thought Leadership, Personal Story); apparent
audience and register; the author's voice markers (rhythm, vocabulary, formality); the thesis, and
where it actually appears.

If `.agents_workspace/blog-voice.md` exists (`ceh-blog:draft-post` writes it from published posts),
read it and judge the draft's voice markers against it: a draft that drifts from the author's usual
register is a finding, not a style to preserve.

### 2. Diagnose

Produce a short, honest bullet list of the specific issues: two if there are two, six if there are
six. Each bullet names the problem and why it matters:

```
**Diagnosis**

- **[Issue name]**: [What's wrong and why it matters]
- ...
```

If the draft is genuinely good and needs only minor polish, say so explicitly before the small
changes:

> This draft is in good shape — the voice is clear, the structure holds, the thesis lands early. I made a few minor edits below, but there are no structural problems to fix.

If it needs a full rewrite (wrong structure, absent thesis, material too thin to polish), flag it
and **wait for their answer**:

> This draft has structural issues that go beyond editing. [Why.] Editing would produce a patched result; a cleaner approach is to redraft using what's working. Proceed with a rewrite, or keep the shape and just clean up the language?

### 3. Edit

Produce the full revised draft, not a summary of changes and not a diff. Work through this
checklist:

**Opening**: first sentence should create tension, a surprising claim, or a concrete moment. Setup or background: cut or reorder — the hook is sentence one or two.

**Closing**: must land on something honest — the open thread (what's unresolved, what the author is watching for, what comes next) or a reserved verdict. Cut "I hope this was helpful" / "Thanks for reading" — but don't replace with a tidy takeaway, lesson, or CTA; that turns a personal story into a lecture. A genuinely open ending is valid. Only a finished series' final post ends with closure.

**Padding**: cut sentences that repeat the previous one, paragraphs that announce instead of doing, connective-only transitions. Test: if removing it changes nothing the reader would notice, remove it.

**Title**: if it could describe hundreds of posts, make it specific — a concrete claim or non-obvious framing. Don't sensationalize; don't be clever at the cost of clarity.

**Vague claims**: flag "many", "often", "some", "significant". Surface a number, name, or example if one exists or can be inferred; otherwise mark `[specific needed]`.

**Tone consistency**: match the author's most natural register. Watch for corporate hedging, passive voice avoiding first person, formality spikes in casual prose.

**Influencer tells**: quiet down any banned tell (see Rules) — fold them back into connected, first-person paragraphs. Never introduce them.

**AI-writing tells**: cut these on every editing pass, even when the author wrote them:

- Stock words: delve, tapestry, testament, landscape, realm, leverage, robust, seamless, crucial,
  pivotal, elevate, unlock, harness, and "navigate" used figuratively.
- Stock frames: "It's not X, it's Y", "In today's fast-paced world", "Whether you're X or Y",
  "Let's dive in", "It's worth noting that", "At the end of the day".
- Reflexive triplets: three adjectives or three parallel clauses where one carries the point.
- Signposting: "In this section, we will", "In conclusion", "Let's take a look at".
- The em dash as the default joint between clauses, where a period, comma, or colon does the job.
- A closing sentence that restates the paragraph it ends.

Replace a tell with the specific thing it stood in for. A tell with nothing behind it is deleted,
not reworded.

**Series continuity**: if the draft is an episode in a series, find the earlier posts (the draft's own directory if it is a file, else a path or URL the user gave; ask once if neither exists) and check against them — versions, dates, what the reader already knows. It should pick up the previous episode's open thread (cross-linked) rather than re-telling a story an earlier post owns.

**Structural fit**: does the post follow its type's natural shape (below)? Scattered steps or a buried story need reordering, not rewording.

**Buried thesis**: core insight past paragraph 3 in a sub-1,000-word post — surface it earlier. Test: does the first paragraph tell the reader what this post is actually about?

**Post type structures** are the target shapes for reordering or restructuring. Every template ends
on **the open thread**: the honest current state — what's unresolved, what the author will watch
for, what comes next. A reserved verdict ("I'm keeping it, for now") is valid. A finished series'
final post ends with closure instead, with no manufactured cliffhangers.

**Lessons Learned:**

```
Hook: The moment it went wrong (or right)
Setup: Context — what were you trying to do?
The Story: What happened, in order
The Turn: When/where things changed
The Insight: What you actually learned (be specific)
The Open Thread: What's unresolved, what you'll watch for, what comes next
```

**How-To:**

```
Hook: The moment this became a problem for you / what it cost you
Overview: What we're doing and why this approach
Steps: Numbered, concrete, with real examples
Pitfalls: What they cost you — narrated as your experience, not warnings issued to the reader
The Open Thread: Where this leaves you — what's still rough, what you're watching for
```

**Opinion / Take:**

```
Hook: State the controversial or non-obvious thesis upfront
Argument 1: [strongest point]
Argument 2: [second point]
Counter-argument: What the other side would say — and why you're still right
The Open Thread: Where you actually land — a reserved verdict is valid; what would change your mind
```

**Project / Launch:**

```
Hook: The moment that led to building it (a scene or a thought), with what it does and who it's for inside the first paragraph
The Origin: Why you built this — what was missing, what frustrated you
How It Works: The interesting parts only — key decisions, not a feature list
What Was Hard: One real technical or design challenge
The Open Thread: What's unresolved, what you're watching for, what comes next
```

**Thought Leadership:**

```
Hook: State the non-obvious claim or question upfront
Argument: Build through specific examples, not abstract assertions
Counter-argument: The strongest objection — acknowledge it, then explain why the thesis holds
Implication: What changes if this view holds?
The Open Thread: What's still unresolved in your own thinking — what you'll watch for next
```

**Personal Story:**

```
Hook: The specific moment this post is really about — one concrete scene
Setup: Enough context to understand what was at stake (brief)
Arc: What happened, what changed, what the turning point was
The Insight: What you actually learned — specific, not "I learned resilience"
The Open Thread: What's unresolved, what you'll watch for, what comes next
```

### 4. Invite feedback

After sharing the edited draft, ask exactly this, one question and no menu of revision directions, because a menu sets the editor's agenda and an open question surfaces what the author feels is off:

> What's working and what still feels off?

Wait for their answer, then address what they raise specifically.

## Rules

- **Preserve voice and intent**: editing, not ghostwriting. Keep the author's vocabulary, register, and perspective: casual stays casual, formal stays formal. The job is to make the author sound more like themselves at their best.
- **Personal voice, not influencer style**: the house voice is first-person, reflective, and quiet — the reader overhears reasoning rather than being taught. Never edit _toward_ influencer tells: punchy standalone one-liner paragraphs, aphoristic closers, imperative lessons aimed at the reader, "If you're building X, then Y" prescriptions, bold pseudo-headers as section labels, tidy meta-takeaway sign-offs, CTA endings. Diagnose these when present and never introduce them. An open or reserved ending is valid, so don't "fix" it into a conviction closer. If the target repo's `CLAUDE.md` defines a blog voice, it overrides the structures above.
- **When the two conflict**: the author's vocabulary, register, and perspective are kept, and the banned tells are quieted even when the author wrote them. Say so in the diagnosis so the author can push back. A blog voice defined in the target repo's `CLAUDE.md` overrides both.
- **Fix real problems only**: if the draft is already good, say so. Don't manufacture edits to justify the skill being invoked.
- **Specifics over generalities**: push concrete details into every abstraction that could hold one.
- **Draft in another language**: edit in that language with the same framework. Don't translate unless asked.
- **Very long draft (3,000+ words)**: same process, and be especially aggressive about padding. Flag if it would be stronger as two pieces.
- **No identifiable thesis**: name it in the diagnosis, offer your best inference, and confirm before editing, because editing toward the wrong thesis polishes the wrong post.
- **Already published**: treat the same as unpublished. Updating a live post or learning for the next one is the same editing work.

## Output

**Diagnosis** first (format above), then the revised draft immediately after:

```
[Title]

[Body]

> **Meta:** [~150-character description — the post's specific angle, not just the broad topic; readable without the title]
```

**Where it goes:** if the draft came from a file, show the diagnosis in chat and write the revision back to that file, keeping its front matter and putting the meta description in the front matter's existing description field instead of the `> **Meta:**` line. A draft pasted into chat gets its revision in chat.

## Stop conditions

- Draft needs a full rewrite → flag it before editing and wait for the author to choose between a rewrite and a language cleanup.

## Hands off to

- Once the user is satisfied, mention: _"When you're ready to share this, `/ceh-blog:repurpose-post` can adapt it into a Twitter/X thread, LinkedIn post, TL;DR, or newsletter blurb."_
- If the input is bullet notes rather than prose, offer to route: _"These look like notes rather than a draft. For turning notes into a post from scratch, `/ceh-blog:draft-post` is a better fit. Want me to switch, or did you have a draft in mind?"_

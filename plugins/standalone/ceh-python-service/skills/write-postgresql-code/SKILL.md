  Load this skill when writing PostgreSQL code in a Python service: tables, indexes, entity IDs,
  status enums, asyncpg queries and transactions, tenant isolation, pools, Alembic migrations.
  Auto-load when a table is added, asyncpg is imported, SQL is written, or alembic runs.

  Requires Python 3.12+ and the `uv` package manager on PATH, plus network access to PyPI.
  `asyncpg` and `alembic` are project dependencies installed by `uv sync`, not assumed globally;
  every command runs via `uv run`. Running queries and migrations needs a reachable PostgreSQL
  server (14+) and a valid `DATABASE_URL`; `psql` is optional for ad-hoc queries. PostgreSQL is a
  separate server, not a Python package.

# Write PostgreSQL Code

Schema, queries, and migrations move together: a new table needs its DDL, the migration that creates
it, and the queries that read it. Use **asyncpg** directly — no ORM — and **Alembic** for every
schema change. Plain parameterized SQL keeps every query visible in review, where an ORM hides it.
Never modify the database schema by hand.

## Procedure

1. Design the table with an application-generated ID, `owner_id`, a bounded status enum, and
   `TIMESTAMPTZ` timestamps.
2. Create or change it only through an Alembic migration with a working `downgrade()`.
3. Write the queries with parameterized placeholders, scoped by `owner_id`, with multi-step writes in a
   transaction.
4. Check the migration against deploy safety: backward-compatible, and two-step for anything destructive.

## Rules

### Schema design

```sql
CREATE TABLE entities (
    entity_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    owner_id       TEXT NOT NULL,
    status         TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    state_snapshot JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_entities_owner_id ON entities(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_entities_status ON entities(status) WHERE status != 'deleted';
```

- `TIMESTAMPTZ` (not `TIMESTAMP`) for all timestamps. Store UTC; display local in UI.
- `JSONB` for flexible/evolving data. Typed columns for fields you filter or sort on.
- All names: `snake_case`. Table names: plural.
- Every user-owned table carries an `owner_id` column so queries can enforce tenant isolation (see
  Tenant isolation below).
- Schema changes are Alembic-managed, backward-compatible, and destructive changes are two-step (see
  Migrations below).

#### Immutable identifiers

Every entity has an application-generated, prefixed, URL-safe identifier. Never use database auto-increment as the public ID — leaks row counts and is meaningless in logs.

```python
import secrets


def generate_id(prefix: str) -> str:
    return f"{prefix}_{secrets.token_urlsafe(12)}"


session_id = generate_id("sess")  # sess_abc123...
resource_id = generate_id("res")  # res_xyz456...
```

#### Bounded status enums

Status values must come from an explicit, closed set. Never trust free-form strings from external callers for status fields.

```python
from enum import StrEnum


class ResourceStatus(StrEnum):
    ACTIVE = "active"
    ARCHIVED = "archived"
    DELETED = "deleted"
```

#### Immutability rules

- IDs are set once at creation, never changed
- `created_at` timestamps are set once, never updated
- Status transitions must be validated — not all transitions are legal
- Document all legal and illegal transitions explicitly

### Queries

Explicit SQL with parameterized placeholders. Never interpolate values into the query string.

```python
row = await conn.fetchrow(
    "SELECT session_id, topic FROM sessions WHERE session_id = $1", session_id
)
```

Page a list with a keyset scan on a unique sort key, never `OFFSET`: an offset re-reads every
skipped row, so page 1,000 costs a thousand pages, and a concurrent insert shifts rows between
pages. Back the sort key with an index on the same columns in the same order.

```python
rows = await conn.fetch(
    "SELECT session_id, topic, created_at FROM sessions"
    " WHERE (created_at, session_id) < ($1, $2)"
    " ORDER BY created_at DESC, session_id DESC LIMIT $3",
    cursor_created_at,
    cursor_session_id,
    limit,
)
```

### Tenant isolation

Every query on user-owned data must filter by the owning user's ID. One user's data must never be reachable by another.

```python
await conn.fetchrow(
    "SELECT * FROM resources WHERE resource_id = $1 AND owner_id = $2",
    resource_id,
    current_user_id,
)
```

### Atomic transactions

Use transactions for all multi-step writes:

```python
async with pool.acquire() as conn:
    async with conn.transaction():
        await conn.executemany(
            "INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, sku, qty) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)",
            [(order_id, i.sku, i.qty) for i in items],
        )
        await conn.execute(
            "UPDATE orders SET total = $1, updated_at = NOW() WHERE order_id = $2",
            new_total,
            order_id,
        )
```

Never assign an ordered number with `SELECT MAX(n) + 1`: two concurrent transactions read the same
maximum and write the same number. Use an identity column or a sequence, or lock the parent row
with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside the transaction that assigns it.

### Connection pool

```python
pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    dsn=settings.database_url,
    min_size=5,
    max_size=20,
    command_timeout=30,
)
```

Create the pool in the FastAPI lifespan function and expose it via `app.state.db_pool`. Never create a pool per request.

### Migrations

#### Setup

```bash
uv add alembic
uv add --dev psycopg2-binary   # sync driver for Alembic; asyncpg is for runtime only
uv run alembic init alembic
```

Configure `alembic/env.py` to use a sync URL (Alembic does not support asyncpg):

```python
sync_url = str(settings.database_url).replace("+asyncpg", "")
config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", sync_url)
```

#### Commands

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add users table"
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run alembic downgrade -1
uv run alembic current
uv run alembic history
```

Apply before integration/system tests:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=$TEST_DATABASE_URL uv run alembic upgrade head
```

#### Migration rules

- Always implement `downgrade()` — every migration must be reversible
- Never edit an applied migration — create a new one instead
- Review every autogenerated file before committing: Alembic misses index names, check constraints, and custom types
- One logical schema change per migration file

#### Deploy safety

- Migrations run **before** the new application version deploys (blue-green safe)
- Every migration must be backward-compatible — the **old** app version must still work after the migration runs
- Never run a migration and a code deploy simultaneously
- Test the migration against a copy of production data before deploying

#### Zero-downtime DDL

A migration that holds a strong lock on a busy table blocks every query behind it. On any table
that serves traffic:

- Set `SET lock_timeout = '5s'` at the top of the migration, so a blocked `ALTER` fails fast and
  can be retried instead of queueing every read behind it.
- Create indexes with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, inside
  `with op.get_context().autocommit_block():`, because it cannot run in a transaction.
- Add a foreign key or check constraint as `NOT VALID`, then `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` in a separate
  migration. Validation takes a weaker lock than adding a validated constraint.
- Add a `NOT NULL` column in three steps: add it nullable, backfill in batches of a few thousand
  rows per transaction, then set `NOT NULL`. On PostgreSQL 12+, add a `CHECK (col IS NOT NULL)
NOT VALID` and validate it first, so `SET NOT NULL` skips the full-table scan.
- Never backfill a large table in the migration itself. Run it as a separate batched script, so a
  slow backfill does not hold the deploy.

#### Two-step destructive changes

Never drop a column, rename a column, or remove a table in a single release.

**Step 1 (this release):** Deploy code that no longer uses the old structure. Old structure stays in place.

**Step 2 (next release):** Drop the old structure now that no code references it.

```sql
-- Step 1 migration: add new column
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN new_column TEXT;

-- Step 2 migration (next release only): drop old column
ALTER TABLE resources DROP COLUMN old_column;
```

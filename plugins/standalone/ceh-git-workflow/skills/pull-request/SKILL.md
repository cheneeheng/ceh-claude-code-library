  Load this skill when a branch is heading into main, any phrasing: open/create/raise a PR, push a
  branch for review, merge/land a PR or a local branch, "merge it", "clean up the branch", or "get
  this branch into main". Covers the PR title and body, self-review, the pre-merge gate and reading
  CI, merge-commit-only strategy, post-merge cleanup, and logging the change under Unreleased in the
  changelog. No version bump, no tag. Not for shipping a version (use ceh-git-workflow:release) or
  reviewing someone else's PR (use ceh-git-workflow:code-review).

  Requires the git CLI on PATH and a git working tree. Opening or merging a PR additionally
  requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated via `gh auth login`, a GitHub remote, push
  permission, and network access. The local no-PR merge needs git alone.

# Pull request

Gets a branch into `main` through a merge commit: open the PR once the definition of done holds,
merge only on a green gate, then clean up and report whether the remote branch survived.

## Procedure

Pick the path from the request, then run only that path:

| Request                                       | Path                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| "open a PR", "push this for review"           | [Open](#open)                       |
| "merge it", "land PR #N", "merge this branch" | [Merge](#merge)                     |
| "commit, PR and merge", "wrap up this branch" | [Land the branch](#land-the-branch) |

### Open

1. Check the [definition of done](#definition-of-done) for the change type and the
   [author self-review](#author-self-review).
2. Write the body to a temp file using the [template](#pr-title-and-description), then:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   gh pr create --title "<type>(<scope>): <short summary>" --body-file body.md
   rm body.md
   if [ "$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq .allow_auto_merge)" = "true" ]; then
     gh pr merge --merge --auto   # queues; lands when CI + approvals go green
   fi
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq .delete_branch_on_merge   # false: the branch survives
   ```

3. Open as a **draft** while CI runs or the work is still settling, and mark it ready only once the
   self-review passes. A draft is safe to queue: auto-merge waits until the PR is marked ready.
   Request the reviewers the [approval rules](#approvals-and-merge-strategy) require.

### Merge

1. Check the [pre-merge gate](#pre-merge-gate). If the branch won't merge cleanly,
   [resolve conflicts](#resolving-conflicts) first.
2. Merge with the [merge commit message](#merge-commit-message):

   ```bash
   if [ "$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq .allow_auto_merge)" = "true" ]; then
     gh pr merge <N> --merge --auto --subject "..." --body-file merge-body.txt
   else
     gh pr merge <N> --merge --subject "..." --body-file merge-body.txt   # gate must be green
   fi
   ```

   With no PR (solo repo, low-risk work), merge locally. Still `--no-ff`, never fast-forward, so
   the branch still lands as one merge commit that reverts as a unit:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name> && git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git merge --no-ff <branch-name>
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Clean up once merged:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git branch -d <branch-name>                # lowercase: refuses an unmerged branch
   git fetch --prune
   ```

4. [Report the remote branch](#reporting-the-remote-branch).

### Land the branch

Changelog → README → commit → open → merge, on the branch you are already on. Each step gates
the next.

1. **On `main`?** Create a branch first with `git checkout -b`, which carries uncommitted work over.
   **Behind `main`?** Rebase before opening, so the gate measures the right tree.
2. Log the change under `## [Unreleased]`: invoke the Skill tool with
   skill="ceh-git-workflow:update-changelog" in **Unreleased mode**. A genuinely invisible change
   (typo, test-only tweak) is the one exception; record the skip.
3. Refresh the README per `ceh-git-workflow:update-readme` if the change is user-facing, or record
   "no update needed".
4. Commit the work and docs following `ceh-git-workflow:commit`. Tree clean before the next step.
5. Run [Open](#open), then [Merge](#merge). If Open queued auto-merge, Merge only waits for it to
   land and cleans up. Wait on CI with `gh run watch`, never by polling by hand.

## Rules

### PR title and description

The title is a Conventional Commits subject (imperative, lowercase, no trailing period, ≤ 72
chars). It seeds the merge commit subject.

```markdown
## What

<One sentence: the change as an outcome for the reader, not a list of files.>

## Why

<The problem or request that motivated it. Link the issue: Closes #NNN.>

## How

<Only the non-obvious decisions and the alternatives rejected. Skip if the diff explains itself.>

## Testing

<What you actually ran and added, so a reviewer can reproduce it. Never imply coverage you
didn't add.>

## Checklist

- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] Tests added or updated for new behavior
- [ ] No new lint or type-check suppressions introduced
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Migrations (if any) are backward-compatible
- [ ] Decision record updated (if a durable decision was made)
- [ ] Attribution included if AI tooling assisted
```

Attribution: append the `attribution.pr` line the session's Git instructions supply, verbatim, as
the last line of the body. Never substitute a literal from this skill or from memory. If settings
supply none, omit it and check the box.

Write the body to a temp file and pass `--body-file`, for `gh pr create` and `gh pr edit` alike.
Never inline it with a shell heredoc or a PowerShell here-string: the temp file avoids all quoting
and behaves the same in both shells.

### Definition of done

| Change type | Bar                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bug fix     | Root cause stated in the PR. A failing test reproduces the bug and now passes. Full suite green. Lint and type checks pass        |
| Feature     | Unit tests for new logic, integration tests for new API surface. Lint and type checks pass. No new suppressions                   |
| Refactor    | No behavior change, proven by existing tests passing unchanged. No tests deleted to make it pass. PR names the structural problem |

Meet the repo's own coverage and type-check bars. Never lower strictness to pass them; fix the
code.

### Author self-review

- Read the full diff (`git diff main...HEAD`) before requesting review.
- Every file in the diff serves the PR's What. Anything else moves to its own PR or gets named in
  the body.
- No commented-out code, debug logs, or `TODO` without a linked issue.
- Rebased on latest `main`, scoped to one concern.

### Size

| PR type      | Recommended                                               | Max     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Bug fix      | ≤ 200 LOC                                                 | 300 LOC |
| New feature  | ≤ 400 LOC                                                 | 600 LOC |
| Refactor     | ≤ 500 LOC                                                 | 800 LOC |
| DB migration | Migration file only; split app changes into a separate PR |         |

Over the guideline, split by layer (schema → service → API). Review quality falls with diff size:
past these sizes a reviewer skims instead of verifying. A migration ships alone because the schema
has to deploy and roll back independently of the app code.

### Approvals and merge strategy

- Approvals: 1 for bug fixes and small features, 2 for new API surfaces, schema, or security
  changes, 1 minimum for an urgent fix. Those three are the hardest to undo once shipped, so they
  get a second reviewer. Never bypass CI.
- **Merge commit only.** Never squash, never rebase-merge. Commits land on `main` as written, and
  the per-PR history is kept on purpose: each PR stays one revertable unit on `main`, and its
  commits stay available to bisect. Keep each commit Conventional Commits format and clean the
  branch as you go.
- **Never pass `--delete-branch`.** Claude Code's permission classifier reads it as destructive
  and blocks the whole command, so the merge fails. Remote cleanup is left to the repo's
  "Automatically delete head branches" setting.

### Pre-merge gate

Do not merge until all hold: CI green, required approvals met, rebased on latest `main`, history
clean (fixup/WIP/debug commits squashed or dropped). With no PR, the gate is whatever signals
exist: rebased, clean history, local checks green.

A rebase or conflict fix after review can change what was reviewed without touching a check. When
a review or local test run finishes, record the change's patch id, and compare it again right
before merging:

```bash
git diff origin/main...HEAD | git patch-id --stable   # first field is the id
```

The same id means the reviewed change is what lands, whatever the commit SHAs. A different id
means the content moved: re-request review, or re-read the diff and rerun the local checks with no
reviewer.

Read CI with `gh run`, anchored to the commit, never the branch:

```bash
gh run watch "$(gh run list -c "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" -L1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')" --exit-status
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed   # why it went red
```

Three traps make a red build look green or a green one look broken:

- `gh pr checks` and `--json statusCheckRollup` return HTTP 403 with a fine-grained PAT lacking
  `checks=read`. That is a permissions error, not a red gate. Use `gh run` instead.
- `gh api .../commits/<sha>/status` returns 200 but is the legacy Statuses API, which Actions
  never writes to: `pending`, `total_count: 0`, forever. Never gate on it.
- `gh run` sees only this repo's Actions. Third-party checks (Codecov, Sonar, GitHub Apps) need
  the rollup or a manual check.

`gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus` works without `checks=read` and is a valid gate, but
`UNSTABLE` cannot tell a pending optional check from a failing one. Use it to gate, `gh run` to
diagnose.

### Resolving conflicts

Rebase on `main` and resolve there, never inside the merge commit, where the resolution escapes
review and CI:

```bash
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
git add <file> && git rebase --continue   # per resolved file
git push --force-with-lease               # your own branch only
```

The gate applies to the rebased state: let CI re-run before merging.

## Output

### Merge commit message

The merge commit reads on its own in `git log main`, never GitHub's default:

```
Merge pull request #<N>: <PR title>

<one or two lines: what it delivers and why it is landing, plus anything a bisect would want>
```

A local merge uses the same shape with the branch's Conventional Commits subject.

### Reporting the remote branch

Never claim the remote branch was deleted without checking
`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq .delete_branch_on_merge`:

- `true`: the PR merged and GitHub deleted the remote branch.
- `false`: the PR merged and **the remote branch still exists**. Give the command that removes it:
  `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`.

Report the same when auto-merge is only queued: the branch outlives the queue either way.

## Stop conditions

- CI red or approvals missing → surface the failing run and wait. Never merge around it.
- The branch needs a version bump or tag → stop and switch to `ceh-git-workflow:release`.

## Hands off to

- Invoke the Skill tool with skill="ceh-git-workflow:update-changelog" in Unreleased mode at step 2
  of [Land the branch](#land-the-branch).

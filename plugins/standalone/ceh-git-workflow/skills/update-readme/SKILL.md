  dependencies, introducing environment variables, or changing the public API surface. Trigger on
  "update the readme", "refresh the docs", "document this feature", "I just shipped X — update
  docs". Not for bug fixes, refactors, or any change that does not affect how someone installs,
  runs, or configures the project, and not for changelogs (use ceh-git-workflow:update-changelog).

# Update README

Keep the project's README.md accurate after a significant change. Prefer surgical edits over
rewrites. Do nothing when nothing material changed.

## Procedure

### 1. Pass the significance gate

Before touching the README, confirm at least one applies:

- New user-facing feature, command, flag, or endpoint
- Installation, build, or run instructions changed
- Dependencies, runtime versions, or environment variables changed
- Configuration file format or required config keys changed
- Project structure changed in a way a new contributor needs to know
- Public API (exported functions, CLI surface, HTTP routes) changed
- Project purpose, name, or scope changed

If none apply, stop (see Stop conditions).

### 2. Discover

1. Find the README: check `README.md` at root, then `readme.md`, `README.rst`, `docs/README.md`. If
   none exists and the change is significant, create `README.md` at root.
2. Understand what changed: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` or `git status` + `git diff`. Look at changed
   files, new top-level files, changes to the project's dependency/build manifest (e.g.
   `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `*.csproj`), new CLI args, route
   definitions, `.env.example`.
3. Read the current README fully before editing.

### 3. Edit the sections the diff touches

Only update sections the diff touches:

- Title/tagline (scope changed)
- Features/What it does (new capability)
- Installation (deps or steps changed)
- Quick start/Usage (entry command or basic flow changed)
- Configuration (env vars or config keys changed)
- API reference/Commands (public surface changed)
- Project structure (top-level layout changed)
- Requirements/Prerequisites (runtime version or system deps changed)

Do not touch license, contributing guidelines, acknowledgments, or badges, unless the change
specifically requires it.

## Rules

- **Surgical edits.** Update only sections affected by the change. Never rewrite the whole README
  when a few edits suffice.
- **Match existing voice.** Preserve tone, heading style, formatting conventions, and keep the prose
  plain and technical.
- **Update in place.** No "Recent changes" section: that is `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **No speculation.** Only document what you can verify from the code.
- **Keep examples runnable.** Flags, args, and paths must match current code.
- **Update the table of contents** if one exists and you added or removed a section.
- Never delete existing content unless it is factually wrong.
- Never commit or push. The caller owns commit order, and a README edit lands in the change's own
  commit.
- In a monorepo, update only the READMEs affected by the change.

## Stop conditions

- No item of the significance gate applies → respond with
  `No README update needed — change is internal/minor.` and stop.

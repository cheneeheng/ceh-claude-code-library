# Run an Agentic Workflow

Run the stages of one `flow.yaml` in order, exactly as written. The runner owns ordering, approvals,
gates, run state and resume; each stage owns its own work. It ends every run with one line,
`FLOW STATUS: done`, `FLOW STATUS: awaiting-approval <stage-id>` or `FLOW STATUS: failed <stage-id>
<reason>`, because a headless caller has nothing else to branch on.

The config format, the validation rules, the `run-state.md` layout and the status line are in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/flow-config-schema.md`. Read it before step 1; this skill does not
restate it.

## Procedure

1. **Load and check the config.** Read `config`, then check it against every rule under Validation
   rules in the schema doc, and the `.js` of each `workflow` stage for carriage returns (a CRLF
   file fails at launch with "control characters that would be hidden in the approval dialog").
   Resolve relative paths against the directory holding `config`. On the first failure end with
   `FLOW STATUS: failed - config invalid: <rule>, <stage>`. Do this before anything runs, because a
   failure at stage 4 of a cheap flow is a smaller loss than one at stage 4 after an irreversible
   stage 3.
2. **Resolve inputs.** Fill each input from the arguments, then its `default`. A missing required
   input is asked for with `AskUserQuestion` in interactive mode and ends the run as
   `FLOW STATUS: failed - missing input <name>` in headless mode.
3. **Preflight capabilities.** For each `workflow` stage, check the Workflow tool is in your tool list
   (search deferred tools for `Workflow` if it is not listed). For each `skill` stage naming a
   plugin skill (`plugin:skill`), check it appears in the available skills. When the capability is
   absent: run the stage's `fallback`, or end with `FLOW STATUS: failed - <stage-id> needs
<capability>` if it is `fail`. Record each fallback chosen in the stage's note. **Never imitate:**
   do not read a workflow's `.js` and do its work by hand to look successful. Files on disk do not
   prove a workflow ran.
4. **Find or create the run.** The run directory is `<run-dir>/<name>/<run-id>/`, where `<run-dir>` is
   `$CEH_WORKFLOW_RUN_DIR`, defaulting to `.agents_workspace/`, and `<run-id>` is the start time
   `YYYYMMDD-HHMM`. Create it unless the flow is not `resumable`, writes no artifact and has no
   `fan_out`, in which case it has no run directory at all.
   - A flow that is not `resumable` always starts a new run and ignores `resume`.
   - Otherwise take the newest run under `<run-dir>/<name>/` whose `run-state.md` has a stage that is
     not `done`. `resume=latest` resumes it, `resume=new` starts a new run, and with neither,
     interactive mode asks and headless mode starts new. With no such run, start new.
   - On resume, take the inputs recorded in `run-state.md`; a re-passed input that differs ends the
     run as `FLOW STATUS: failed - inputs changed on resume`.
   - Check now that the repo's `.gitignore` ignores the run directory, and append it if not. Run
     artifacts are never committed.
5. **Walk the stages** in order, skipping those already `done`. For each stage:
   1. **Check `reads`.** Every input file must exist, else `failed <id> missing-input <artifact>`.
   2. **Approval.** If the stage has `approval` and is not covered by an earlier approval, see
      Approvals below.
   3. **World check.** If `unsafe_to_rerun`, evaluate `world_check` now, on every attempt and every
      resume. It is the stage's first action, ahead of the run state, because state is only a record.
      When it is false the effect may already exist: stop with `failed <id> world-check-failed`. Do
      not skip the stage and do not guess that it finished.
   4. **Dispatch** per `run.kind`, below.
   5. **Gate**, below.
   6. **Record** the stage in `run-state.md` right away, with the gate evidence in its note.
6. **End** with the status line, under Output.

### Launch arguments

The arguments are `key=value` tokens. Quote values that contain spaces.

| Argument  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config`  | Required. Path to `flow.yaml`. Unset or unreadable: `FLOW STATUS: failed - config unreadable`.                                                                                                     |
| `mode`    | `interactive` (default) or `headless`. Explicit, never guessed: a skill cannot tell which it runs in, and a wrong guess either hangs on a question or skips a confirmation. Any other value fails. |
| `resume`  | `latest` or `new`. Default: ask in interactive mode, `new` in headless.                                                                                                                            |
| `approve` | Comma-separated stage ids approved in advance. Honoured in both modes and recorded with source `approve=<id>`.                                                                                     |
| other     | The flow's own `inputs`. An unknown key fails the run, so a typo is not silently ignored.                                                                                                          |

A resumed session may instead carry the message `APPROVED <stage-id>`. Treat it as approval of that
stage when `run-state.md` shows it `awaiting-approval`, with source `resume-prompt`; otherwise ignore
it.

### Dispatch

Pass `{run}`, every input path and the path of every schema the stage reads or writes, since an
isolated stage sees nothing else. Substitute placeholders in every value first.

- **`skill`** — invoke the Skill tool with the named skill and `args` plus `run=<run path>`. The
  call runs in your own context, so write its artifact to the `writes` file yourself if it does not.
- **`agent`** — dispatch the Agent tool with the stage's `subagent_type`. The prompt carries the
  `instructions` (or the instruction to load the named skill), `{run}`, the `reads` paths with their
  schema paths, the `writes` paths with theirs, and these three rules: it cannot ask the user, it
  must not invoke `run-agentic-workflow`, and a result that only exists in its reply is lost, so it
  writes its artifact to the stated path.
- **`script`** — run `bash <script path> <args>` with Bash through the path as resolved against
  `config`'s directory. A non-zero exit is a red gate.
- **`inline`** — do the `instructions` yourself.
- **`workflow`** — call the Workflow tool by name with `args`, and wait for its result. Never launch
  it with a `/<name>` slash command, which fails headless. Write the result to the stage's one
  `writes` file in the form its schema gives. A launch that is denied or errors is
  `failed <id> workflow-denied`; the fallback is for an absent tool only, because a fallback there
  would hide a missing permission. Drop `null` results.
- **`fan_out`** — read the item list from `items_from` using its schema. More than `max_items` fails
  the stage as `too-many-items`. Derive each item id as `item_id` says. Dispatch one `agent` per item
  with no output file yet, at most `max_parallel` at once, each writing its own `output` file. After
  they return, count the files against the item list, which is the first half of the gate: a worker
  that died leaves no file, not a failing one.

### Approvals

The approval belongs to the runner, never to a stage: `AskUserQuestion` is stripped from every
subagent, so a dispatched stage cannot ask and would run straight through. Never let a stage ask.

If the stage id is in `approve=` or recorded as approved in `run-state.md`, proceed and record the
source. Otherwise:

| Mode        | Behaviour                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| interactive | Ask with `AskUserQuestion`, showing what `show` names: the exact data, the whole batch once. If it cannot be answered, end as `failed <id> no-user-to-ask`. Approve proceeds. Decline ends as `failed <id> declined` with the stage `pending`, so a resumed run asks again.                                                        |
| headless    | Follow `approval.headless`: `stop` writes `{run}/approval-<id>.md` with the `show` content, marks the stage `awaiting-approval`, prints that content above the status line and ends as `awaiting-approval <id>`. `preapproved-only` does the same unless the id was in `approve=`. `fail` ends as `failed <id> approval-required`. |

A stage named in another stage's `covers` shares that approval and does not ask again. Record each
approval in `run-state.md` with its source and time. Never proceed on silence.

### Gates

After a stage, evaluate `gate.check` with Read, Grep or Bash, and record one line of evidence in the
stage's note. Do not accept "looks right".

- **Green** — mark the stage `done` and continue.
- **Red, `stop`** — mark the stage `failed` and end as `failed <id> <what the check found>`. Never
  continue degraded and never skip a stage to reach a later one: the order is the only reason a later
  stage's inputs are valid.
- **Red, `retry`** — re-run the stage with `retry.changes` applied and the failure output in front of
  it, at most `retry.max` more times, recording the attempt in the note. Run `world_check` again
  before each attempt. When the bound is spent, stop as above. Never raise the bound.

## Rules

- **Run the config as written.** Do not reorder stages, merge them, add a stage, or tune a bound.
  Where the config is wrong, fail and say which rule. The stages and gates are what was approved,
  so a run that edits them is no longer the approved workflow.
- **Never imitate an absent tool and never fall back after a denial.**
- **One level deep.** A stage may not run this skill, and a stage you dispatch is told so.
- **No secrets on disk.** Run artifacts and `run-state.md` hold references to secrets, never values.
- **Do not stop to ask in headless mode,** except through the approval path above.

## Output

### Run state and the status line

When the flow is `resumable`, keep `{run}/run-state.md` in the layout the schema doc gives: stage
states, approvals, and the status line. Update it after every stage change, not at the end, because
context that dies mid-run takes anything unwritten with it. A resumed run skips stages marked `done`
and re-enters the first that is not.

The last line of your reply is the status line, and with `run-state.md` it is the last line of that
file too. Say nothing after it.

## Stop conditions

- The config fails a validation rule, an input is missing or a capability is absent → end before
  step 1 with `FLOW STATUS: failed - <reason>`.
- A gate is red and stops the run, a world check fails, an input file is missing or an approval is
  declined → `FLOW STATUS: failed <stage-id> <reason>`.
- A headless approval is needed and not given → `FLOW STATUS: awaiting-approval <stage-id>`.

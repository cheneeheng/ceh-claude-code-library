  Load this skill when shipping a version: bump it, write the changelog section, land the bump
  through a PR, then tag the merge commit on main and publish the GitHub release. Trigger on "cut a
  release", "ship a release", "bump the version", "bump and release", "tag a release", "publish a
  release", "run the release flow", "do the full release", and on an urgent production fix that
  must ship now ("hotfix", "critical fix"). Auto-load whenever a version field changes in any
  project manifest (pyproject.toml, package.json, plugin.json, marketplace.json, Cargo.toml,
  *.csproj, build.gradle) or a git tag is being created. Not for landing a branch with no version
  (use ceh-git-workflow:pull-request).

# Release

Ships vX.Y.Z: the bump lands on `main` through a reviewed PR, and the tag and GitHub release
happen only after the merge, pointing at the merge commit, never at the feature branch.

## Procedure

Pick the path, then run it top to bottom. Each step gates the next.

| Situation                                           | Path                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Ship a version (default)                            | [Full release](#full-release)       |
| The bump already merged to `main`, only tag + notes | [Tag and publish](#tag-and-publish) |
| P1/P2 production issue that cannot wait             | [Hotfix](#hotfix)                   |

### Full release

1. **Decide the bump** per the [bump table](#versioning). Never below the current version.
2. **Branch** `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` from up-to-date `main`.
3. **Bump** the version in every manifest the project ships. All must read the same vX.Y.Z.
4. **Changelog:** invoke the Skill tool with skill="ceh-git-workflow:update-changelog" to write
   the vX.Y.Z section. Gate: section written and semver-validated.
5. **Docs:** refresh the README if the release is user-facing, and CLAUDE.md if project facts
   changed. Otherwise record "no update needed".
6. **Commit** with the [release commit message](#release-commit-message). Tree clean.
7. **Land** the branch: open the PR and merge it per `ceh-git-workflow:pull-request`. Gate: CI
   green, approvals met, merged to `main`.
8. **Tag and publish** per [Tag and publish](#tag-and-publish).

### Tag and publish

On `main`, after the merge:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main   # the merge commit is now HEAD
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z — <summary>"   # annotated: some repos reject lightweight tags
git push origin vX.Y.Z
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file notes.md && rm notes.md
```

`notes.md` is the vX.Y.Z changelog section plus the attribution footer (see
[Attribution](#attribution)).

### Hotfix

The [Full release](#full-release) with these differences:

1. Branch `fix/critical-<description>` from `main`, and commit the fix itself as
   `fix(<scope>): <description>`. Minimal scope: nothing unrelated rides along.
2. The bump is PATCH. It may commit on the same branch after the fix.
3. Review is fast-tracked to 1 approval, but CI must pass. A broken hotfix is worse than a delayed
   one.
4. The PR body links the incident and names the symptom, so the merge commit explains itself.
5. After publishing, deploy staging then production (both, however abbreviated). Confirm the
   symptom is gone and error rates are back to baseline before declaring the incident resolved,
   and be ready to roll back. A P1/P2 gets a post-mortem within 48 hours.

## Rules

### Versioning

Tags are `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

| Change                                                  | Bump  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Breaking change (`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer or `!` type) | MAJOR |
| New backward-compatible feature                         | MINOR |
| Fixes, chores, docs, refactors                          | PATCH |

When in doubt, PATCH. Versions only increase. Pre-releases take a suffix (`v1.4.0-rc.1`,
`v1.4.0-beta.1`) and sort below the final `v1.4.0`.

### Gates

- One version everywhere: every manifest reads the same vX.Y.Z before the commit.
- Tag the merge commit on `main`, never the feature branch: `git pull origin main` first.
- Never tag or release on a red gate. Surface it and wait.

### Attribution

| Artifact             | Setting              | Where the footer goes           |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Release commit       | `attribution.commit` | Last line of the commit message |
| GitHub release notes | `attribution.pr`     | Last line of the notes file     |

Reproduce the line the session's Git instructions supply, verbatim. Never substitute a literal
from this skill or from memory. If the setting is empty, omit it. The tag message takes none.

## Output

### Release commit message

The release commit is where the diff explains least: it shows version strings and changelog prose,
not what shipped or why the bump is that level. Always multi-line, written to a temp file and
committed with `git commit -F`, never `-m`:

```
chore: release vX.Y.Z

<1-3 sentences: what this release ships, in the changelog's terms>

- Bump: <PATCH|MINOR|MAJOR>: <the change that forces this level>
- Manifests: <which moved, old -> new>
- Docs: <changelog / README / CLAUDE.md updated, or "no update needed" and why>

<attribution footer>
```

## Stop conditions

- Bump level unclear between MINOR and MAJOR → state the breaking candidate and ask.
- CI red or approvals missing at step 7 → surface it and wait. Never tag around it.

## Hands off to

- Invoke the Skill tool with skill="ceh-git-workflow:update-changelog" to write the vX.Y.Z
  section at step 4 of [Full release](#full-release).

  Load this skill when writing a commit message or staging changes for a commit: choosing the
  correct Conventional Commits type and scope, formatting the subject line, writing a useful body,
  or adding footers for breaking changes and issue references. Auto-load whenever a git commit is
  being made, a commit message is being composed, or staged changes are being reviewed before
  committing.
compatibility: >-
  Requires the git CLI on PATH, a git working tree, and a configured `user.name` / `user.email`.
  If the repo installs commit hooks, their interpreters (e.g. Python for pre-commit) must also be
  present - none is assumed by this skill itself.

# Commit Messages — Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body — explain why, not what]

[optional footer — breaking changes, issue refs]
```

## Procedure

1. Stage one logical change: `git add <files>`.
2. Single-line message (subject only):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <short summary>"
   ```

3. Multi-line (body or footer needed) — write the message to a temp file and commit with `-F`,
   then delete the file:

   ```bash
   # Write the message to msg.txt:
   #   <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
   #
   #   <body — explain why, not what>
   #
   #   <footer — BREAKING CHANGE or Closes #NNN>
   git commit -F msg.txt && rm msg.txt
   ```

   Never build a multi-line message with an inline shell heredoc or a PowerShell `@'...'@`
   here-string: the temp-file path avoids all shell quoting and behaves identically in PowerShell
   and Bash.

## Types

| Type       | When to use                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or behavior                                  |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                                  |
| `refactor` | Code change with no behavior change                      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                  |
| `test`     | Adding or changing tests                                 |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                                       |
| `style`    | Formatting only — whitespace, semicolons; no code change |
| `build`    | Build system, packaging, or external dependencies        |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration and pipelines                        |
| `chore`    | Maintenance, tooling; anything not covered above         |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit (body: `Reverts <sha>`)        |

## Scope

The optional `(<scope>)` names the area of the codebase touched — a module, package, or
component (`auth`, `orders`, `api`). Pick the narrowest noun that covers the change. Omit the
parentheses entirely for repo-wide changes (`chore: bump all dev dependencies`). Keep it
lowercase and consistent with scopes already used in the log (`git log --oneline`).

## Rules

- One logical change per commit. Don't mix a refactor with a feature, or two unrelated fixes —
  split them so each can be reviewed and reverted on its own.
- Subject line: imperative mood ("add", not "added"/"adds"), lowercase, no trailing period,
  ≤ 72 characters.
- Body: explain _why_, not _what_ — the diff already shows what changed. Wrap at 72 columns.
  Use `-` bullets for multiple points. Separate it from the subject with one blank line.
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer with migration notes (or a `!` after the
  type/scope: `feat(api)!: ...`).
- Reference issues: `Closes #123` (auto-closes on merge) or `Refs #456` (links only) in footer.
- Attribution: use the footer the environment already supplies — the `attribution.commit` value
  from Claude Code settings, surfaced verbatim in the session's Git instructions. Reproduce that
  line exactly; never substitute a literal from this skill or from memory. If settings set
  `attribution.commit` to `false`/empty, or no attribution line is supplied, omit the footer.

## Output

Subject, bad vs. good:

```
bad:  fixed bug                          # not imperative, no type/scope, vague
bad:  fix(orders): Fixed the bug where.. # capitalized, past tense, trailing detail
good: fix(orders): reject cancel on shipped orders
```

Full example (subject + body + footers):

```
feat(orders): add bulk cancel endpoint

Supports cancelling up to 100 orders per request. Single-cancel
endpoint remains unchanged; no migration needed.

  Load this skill when building from a planning document: implement a SKELETON.md or ITER_NN.md,
  including version-tagged variants like SKELETON_v2.md or v2_ITER_03.md. Reads the plan
  frontmatter to determine artifact type and scope, then implements each in-scope section in order
  (§01–§06), resolving iteration pointers and depends_on chains to find the authoritative spec.
  Trigger on "implement from plan", "build from the plan", "implement the skeleton", "build
  ITER_02", or when the user points at a plan file and asks to build it. Not for writing the plan
  (use plan-fullstack-app-iteratively or plan-fullstack-app-to-mvp), auditing built code against a
  plan (use review-against-plan), or a small non-feature change to a built version (use
  patch-built-version).

# Implement From Plan

Translate a SKELETON.md or ITER_NN.md into working code, section by section, without inventing
scope beyond what is written. Done means every in-scope section is implemented and the completion
summary is reported.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/plan-schema.md` for the full schema before starting. The
section table, pointer rules, and resolution order there are authoritative.

## Procedure

### 1. Locate and parse the plan docs

1. Find the target plan files. If the user did not specify, look for `SKELETON` and `ITER_NN`
   files (`.md`) under `.agents_workspace/planning/` (where the planning skills write them) or any
   subfolder within it. Filenames may carry a version tag as a prefix or suffix, e.g.
   `SKELETON_v2.md`, `v2_ITER_03.md`. See "File Naming and Version Variants" in
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/plan-schema.md` for the matching rules.
2. Group the discovered files by version tag into plan families (untagged files are the default
   family). If more than one family exists, confirm with the user which version is the target.
   Within a version, the iteration whose frontmatter has `mvp: true` is the sequence terminator:
   the plan runs SKELETON → ITER_01 → … → that terminator.
3. Read the YAML frontmatter to determine:
   - `artifact`: is this SKELETON or ITER?
   - For ITER: `sections_changed` (implement these), `sections_unchanged` (resolve via pointer),
     `depends_on` (the prior artifacts whose content this iteration relies on, its dependency
     chain).
   - For SKELETON: `sections` (implement all listed sections).
4. By default the target is the whole sequence up to and including the `mvp: true` iteration:
   implement the SKELETON, then each ITER_NN in `depends_on` order. Never sweep past the mvp
   terminator in a default full-sequence run. If the user named a single iteration, target only
   that one and use its `depends_on` chain to resolve unchanged sections for context.
5. Exclude **patch ITERs** (frontmatter `patch: true`) from the default run. They sit past the
   terminator and are produced by the `patch-built-version` skill. Implement one only when it is
   the named target, on its own.

### 2. Resolve pointers before starting

For any section in `sections_unchanged`, find its authoritative spec now, before writing any code,
by following the resolution order in `plan-schema.md`. Load that content into context so
implementation is not interrupted to look it up.

### 3. Implement section by section

Work through sections in numerical order. For each section:

1. State which section you are starting and what it covers (one line).
2. Read the section spec. Implement exactly what is specified, no more, no less.
3. When you finish a section, confirm it is done before moving to the next.

Section-specific notes:

- **§01 Concept**: no code output. Load the concept as context. Confirm your understanding in one
  sentence so the user can catch misreads early.
- **§02 Architecture**: create the project scaffold (directories, empty modules), stub data model
  classes/types, and stub route handlers. Do not fill in logic yet unless the spec includes it.
- **§03 Tech Stack**: install and configure the specified stack. Pin versions only if the spec
  specifies them.
- **§04 Backend**: check whether an `implementation-gotchas.md` file exists in the project (e.g.
  `docs/references/implementation-gotchas.md`). If it does, read it before implementing any backend
  code. Implement the endpoints and services described for this section only.
- **§05 Frontend**: same as §04, check for `implementation-gotchas.md` first. Implement only the
  screens and components listed in this section's spec.
- **§06 LLM/Prompts**: only present if the app has LLM integration. Implement the model wiring,
  system prompt, and input/output handling as specified.

## Rules

- Do not implement sections outside `sections_changed` (ITER) or `sections` (SKELETON).
- Do not add features, routes, components, or dependencies not in the spec.
- If the spec is ambiguous, state your assumption and use the simplest interpretation. Never guess
  silently.

## Output

After all sections are done, report:

- Sections implemented and key artifacts created
- Assumptions made
- Sections skipped and why (e.g. §06 absent because no LLM integration)
- Items the user should verify manually (e.g. env vars needing real values)

## Stop conditions

- A section spec is missing or incomplete → stop and ask instead of inventing it.
- More than one plan family exists and the user named none → ask which version is the target.
